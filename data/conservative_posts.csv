DaHomieNelson92,0,False,,,t3_b83064,9,0,,https://www.reddit.com//r/Conservative/comments/b83064/im_not_seeing_enough_memes/,29,"The mods of this sub made the [logical decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b7ww6s/please_post_articles_on_rconservativearticles_and/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app) of turning this sub to an epic, high energy conservative meme sub. This is vital for the conservative cause because it‚Äôs been determined [scientifically](http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~rakison/memes.pdf) that memes ‚Äúare a powerful force shaping our cultural and biological evolution‚Äù (Blackmore, 2016). 

However, as of 9:19 AM, there have only been 10 high quality memes in this sub since the mods‚Äô decision. Compared to how /r/Conservative unfortunately was (with over 5 articles per minute on average) that‚Äôs too low. How are we supposed to own the libtards (like /r/TopMindsOfReddit) with facts and logic with those rookie numbers? 

Therefore, in order to save the world from left-wing destruction, we must collectively [as individuals in a group, not in a communism way because that‚Äôs homosexual; comrade Goolog] pump out memes in mass production.

Only then will these libtards be embarrassed of their ideologies, will check their privileges, and see the *right* side of history. 

Conclusion: As a regular /r/TheDonald user, MAKE MORE MEMES! **MAGA!**. Be like us!

I was successful and happy to live my little life.  The worries started in 2008 when the financial company I was with had to close its doors rather suddenly.  I had experienced hiccups in my career before, or moved jobs before, but this was like nothing I'd ever seen.  For my talent and experience, I couldn't get arrested.  I lost everything.

So went the next eight years.  

I struggled and I moved around, place to place, trying to get back to good, but it felt like the opportunities that had once been there were gone and it felt like forever.  I sold t-shirts for a while.  I went from excess to floating bills, and trying to keep the lights on.  

I always vote, but I didn't vote last round.  I couldn't.  I thought Trump was crazy and Hilary was ... well, *no*.  

These past two years have seen a change that I would never have thought possible.  The economy rebounded so fast that I wasn't sure what was happening.  And then doors began to open again, and I walked through one of them and now I have my life back again.

I'm not a kid, I've seen presidents come and go, but I've never felt an effect as tangible as what I am experiencing now.  This is deeply personal to me - my life has changed.

I still think Trump is a little crazy, but I'm down with it and I will literally run to the polls to re-elect him.  And if you think I'm the exception, you're nuts.  There are millions of me who have seen their worlds slowly come back again or get tangibly and personally better.  That's a story that hasn't been told through politics in a very long time.

How brilliant is Trump!! ¬†With 2020 looming, he knows he needs to win the battleground states. ¬† These are the ones Hillary barely campaigned in, then lost, and blamed the Russians.

Trump has  promised $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative that would benefit 3 of the 5 true battleground states: Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. ¬† That gives his a strategic advantage over any opponent in those key states. ¬†It also undercuts the inevitable criticisms from the Left about how Republicans don‚Äôt care about the environment. ¬† He scores multiple points with one action. ¬†

Absolutely brilliant!

Upon further reading of this, I read that the CIA intervened in these countries in the 70s and 80s to stop the spread of communism, and installed governments that could be called military dictatorships, and funded these governments which fought various wars that caused many to flee.  **Is it our fault that these countries are dumps?**

At the same time, I believe the U.S. government did the same thing in countries like Chile to stop communism's spread, and Chile is doing juuuust fine, so it would seem that desperation in the Northern Triangle was a result of lack of economic development/infrastructure and the cocaine trade. So I am severely confused, with no one really knowledgeable to talk to about this.  I tried submitting to Ben Shapiro's mailbag but I haven't gotten him to read it yet.  

I chose to post about this in r/Conservative because I figured you guys would be playing defense and be more logical than a liberal playing offensive and going on a rant about how bad America is, with no logic.

Hello everyone. The school board of my public school district recently approved a motion to fly the BLM flag on the flagpole in front of my high school that I attend as a student. I would like to hear your thoughts regarding the following:

1. What are some arguments against flying the flag of any political group or movement in front of a public high school?
2. Is there any precedent for this?
3. What are some logic-based arguments against BLM itself that can be supported by evidence/fact?
4. What would be some of the best ways to bring community attention to these opinions and inspire a change in direction?

I would like to say that I am completely willing to go against this motion and idea to the best of my ability and am unafraid of potential repercussions for exercising my right to freedom of speech.",My Public High School Will Be Flying the Black Lives Matter Flag,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b6b5tj/my_public_high_school_will_be_flying_the_black/
