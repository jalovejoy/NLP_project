jonfla,That sign in Daley Plaza said Not Poland but Germany so it looks like thay were protesting Poland paying reparations and saying Germany should.  I don't see any signage about anti anything except money.  If there had been signage that was anti- semitic then that gathering in Daley Plaza would have had a counter protest. NSZ arm bands does not mean antisemitism at least in World War 2. The National Armed Forces weren’t antisemitic.In The war there were dozens of Jewish officers in their ranks. In January 1945 they liberated 280 Jewish women slated for death from Holysov.In the post war period they fought against the Communists and did kill several hundred to a thousand Jewish partisans but from what u understand the Stalinist forces built some partisan groups of different ethnic groups. In other words it’s a consequence of the particular soviet informal military unit they fought and not part of ethnic or religious conflict.No idea about these dudes. They opposed a bill. Maybe they did it because they are racist. Not enough info in the article to prove it especially since their NSZ stuff was frankly a lie. Nope. It was taking mainly about one the reporter witness at Daly Plaza in Chicago.But the groups that are described as antisemitic aren’t antisemitic to my knowledge. But I don’t speak polish. So who knows. Opposing a racist bill that breaks American Polish and international laws and deals - what's anti-Semitic in that again? On one hand I'm glad all this bullshit is coming out so we can see it maybe deal with it. On the other I'm shocked by the residual hate fear and ignorance in the US. I had no illusions that racism was dead when Obama was elected but god damn seems like 40% of this country is outta their minds.

progress18,"Trump overwrote security officials when giving a high security clearance to some drug addict. I can’t wait till we find out who that was.Easy guess would be Steve Banon.. but I’m hoping is someone more juicy like Ivanka or Kushner.. they seem like undercover addicts with daddy issues Yeah I'm thinking the odds are pretty good it was Bannon. I'm really worried about what that utter piece of crap did with his clearance while he had it. If you are a conservative take a breath and think about what you would say if Obama or Hillary did this. Exactly. But they won’t be honest with themselves. Hypocrite assholes I'm libertarian trust me this shit has me bothered Trump supporters have turned into defenders of him no matter what because so many of his critics focus on issues with no substance (at least the ones that even make it to that community) If you're a libertarian the existence of a security clearance bothers you already doesn't it? You guys don't think anything should be classified from the citizens is that correct? Honest question as I have issues with ability of classifying information without oversight. I mean there has to be some level of things that don't go to the public like how nuclear weapons are made etc but if it's something like the government straight up lying about something that's different I'm not an anarchist I agree I don't want nuclear codes etc. public but find it troubling that elected officials aren't immediately given top security clearance. We elected them they should immediately have total clearance to request any information they feel that they need. I stress I am speaking about elected officials such as senators not appointed individuals. If we elected them we want them to make informed decisions on our well being. So I am against the president ruling something as secret for national security and being able to withhold it from congress. Both sides of the isle are guilty of that and it is incredibly dangerous and it is a way around checks and balances. I can see that I would say most documents should definitely be allowed to members of the Senate. I might be wrong but I imagine that the executive branch would hold most information as classified for military strategy r&d and old sketchy secret plans made during the cold war I'd bet big money that Jared and Ivanka are at the top of that list. Of course he did.  Trump is a traitor.Destroying American national security is his primary purpose. I don't think it's his primary purpose just the primary side effect.Trump's primary purpose has always been to make himself money.I honestly believe that all the shady shit he did involving Russia wasn't because he's some double agent but because he wanted to build a tower in Moscow.His actions aren't motivated by complex thoughts just narcissism and greed.

davidreiss666,They don't want anyone convicted of domestic violence charges to lose out on the opportunity to buy a gun. Think of the gun lobby's feelings!  A gun manufacturer may go home with a few dollars less and cry. Is the NRA still about gun manufacturers or guns for that matter? I have a feeling it's more about recruiting for the far right. Think of all the police officers who couldn’t own a gun anymore. This articles focus is talks about new provisions with stalking and already mentions that people convicted of domestic abuse are already not allowed to buy a gun under law 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9).

progress18,"Kids aren't affected by this. This only affects single adults without children I should know better than to post an opinion based on a headline. Thank you for pointing this out. I still disagree with this - no one in the richest country the world has ever known should go hungry but my comment was incorrect so I deleted it First take the healthcare then take away food stamps WIC can get erased as well. Hell let's just do Away with minimum wage and turn the shitty states into sweatshops. What what what??? You lousy humans need healthcare AND food. Sheesh. Needy. Needy. Why not just become Venezuela? /s Impeach this Heartless SOB ! You’d rather see him hung for treason? the only way this should be allowed to happen is if it comes from walmart employees finally being paid enough to feed themselves. 750000 people wasting tax payer dollars that could be used on more productive things. Did you know that over 200 million dollars of SNAP money stolen from taxpayers is used on fats candys and sugars? This could be even higher because not all fatty foods are specifically listed. Love that 200 million dollars going to the 30% obesity rate huh https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/foods-typically-purchased-supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap-households In 30 years when robots account for 50% of the labor force and 3 in 5 people are both unemployed and unemployable will these attitudes change?The GOP has become the Marie Antoinette party. Will they share her fate? If you're like most Trump supporters you'll be dead of old age by then so don't worry about it. Yeah and most of them need 2-3 jobs to stay afloat. Unemployment is a bad metric for how the working class is actually doing. That's just dumb. The government is not your mommy. k Is that why trump people constantly blame HRC for their shit president? Soooooo much personal responsibility. Last months Jobs Numbers were shit by the way time to beat a new dead horse.Edit: And for anyone not aware the trend of unemployment began in 2009 and recently has plateaued it's why trump has stopped beating that dead horse jobs numbers last month were way lower than expectations and most economists are predicting a recession. Every republican president you mean Now you're getting it.Democrat comes in and overspends by trillions on stupid programs that make people feel good but aren't effective. (I: food stamps)Conservatives come in and clean up the mess.Rinse wash repeat. You Have no fucking grasp of the economy. Bush tanked Clinton’s ecconomy Obama fixed it now trump is tanking Obama’s economy. You people don’t know jack shit just feel out your facts. Do you not remember the surplus under Clinton Obama dropping unemployment from over 9% to above 5%? Fuck you people make it hard to give you a chance when you just fucking lie without even thinking about it. Bush fixed Clinton’s economy? What does meth taste like? Go read Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell and really think about all the things you just said. ""Give us a chance"" haha that ship has sailed. Go fuck yourself. Go graduate high school I could talk GDP job growth and the markets with you but you'd rather dabble in insult. Get the fuck over your dumb ass. You insulted me first you fuckstain. You dont get a healthy economy from giving lazy stupid fucks like you money for free. You get a healthy economy when people are WORKING.PS my wife and I have 5 degrees between us. I graduated second in my class with a 3.9 gpa Are you shitting me? Jobs performances last month were well under expectations fucking condescending ass hat. Only 20000 where projections were 300000. Obama brought unemployment from 9.7% under Bush ignorant ass fuck to  5.3% now trump brings it down a little over a percent and you want me to suck his dick for plateauing the jobs growth handed to him on a silver fucking platter? Now are you going to talk actual numbers besides the 900 degrees you have between you and the family dog? I enjoy a good amount of chaos as much as the next person but this is the difference between people eating or not. It’s heartbreaking to see such callous decisions being made for cruel reasons. Especially as it's children who are going to carry the brunt of it and they have no responsibility in all this. Children should not be receiving the brunt of it. This only affects single able-bodied adults without dependents The GOP don’t seem to give a shit no??  And if it’s the children of people who continue to vote for these criminals then so be it.   Yeah it sucks... but it’s about time people start suffering for the actions of the people they vote for.... and their families.   So again I say let it all go to shit for them. Go for the families then? That's exactly what Trump said. Can we be better than this? Yeah those damn 7-year-old kids voting Republican...what were they thinking? Many of them did this to themselvesRight Fuck those hungry kids they knew what they were signing up for by being born.../s That approach makes me really uncomfortable. Reddit is full of kids who think Accelerationsim is a legitimate ideology to advocate mainly because they haven't any skin in the game. Or lived long enough to see their friends hit hard times and need assistance. It’s really heartbreaking. Its nice to say that from a position of privilege and have enough money to afford food and not be dependant on programs like this. In my experience you don't change people's minds by punishing them but by giving them something better than what they have. And people don't have the time and energy to educate themselves about politics when they're busy not starving. This will only create more chaos and people like Trump benefit from chaos as it fuels their supporters' anger and fear. They will blame the wrong people because Fox is going to tell them to do just that. You may know a couple people who you think don’t need it but I volunteer at a food banks and meet dozens upon dozens of people who do need it while they are working to repair their life. Maybe a small amount of people abuse this but that is nothing at all in comparison to all the people who genuinely do need the assistance. Despite your fees before reals comment:When compared with those total figures the fraud identified in 2016 amounted to a mere 0.9% of the total. That was up from 0.5% in 2012.Or put another way 99% of the benefit dollars were in no way associated with fraud assuming that the government is doing its job of identifying malfeasance. If the fraud figure continues to grow at the same rate then there is a real problem but so far not so much.https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonconstable/2018/04/04/the-facts-about-food-stamp-fraud/#765a95e6f880 What you posted proves that fraud has doubled in 4 years. And thats just SNAP. If you round up to 1% that's 440000 people roughly abusing the program (or half a billion dollars). That doesn't seem like a lot to you? posting things is easy but what exactly are you trying to say?Please keep in mind that I am very supportive of WICK and SNAP and anything else that helps people get back on their feet. What you posted proves that fraud has doubled in 4 years.And yet still a 99% honest rate.  Any program would die for a 99% rate. I agree that's great! But if we know about this fraud why wouldn't we do something about it? I think Trump is a terrible person and a terrible president but he might have it right on this one by tightening existing laws to be more on the level. Nah.  We already strive to be better.  Your rhetoric is more small government starve the beast nonsense which tells me everything I need to know. What are you even talking about? Lol Completely broken? Nah not in the least bit.

progress18,The important part of the article:Enacting a constitutional amendment would be an uphill battle if not an impossible goal. The amendment would first need to win over two-thirds of both chambers of Congress and then be ratified by three-fourths of the states. Men had to give women the right to vote. Of course those with power seem to be immune to pressure until it is applied. Yeah a lot more people agreed with that and more people cared about it. Voters don’t seem to believe that to be that much of a concern since it’s much more abstract then your wife or sister standing next to you being unable to vote. Omg it’s like he has been reading all the emails I’ve sent!! Ahh fellow Oregonian. High five 🖐 Aw yeah!!! High five for having representatives that aren’t a complete embarrassment! Ha that’s great I’ve been writing to my dem senator and even my congressman. I hope they are listening! If we can learn one thing from the Republicans do not stop pushing until public opinion eventually turns in your favor. But there is one thing different about Democrats. Democrats always fight for what is right for all Americans whether they are Republican or Democrat. That’s only because what is right also helps them gain/maintain power which doesn’t really diminish the fact that they still do the right thing.  If doing what was right would help republicans get more votes then you can be sure as shit that they’d be doing the right thing too but that’s just not how things go. My point is Republicans have no morals. They have lost their moral compass completely to extremists narcissists and sociopaths. There is a real difference in the character of the people who make up the Republican Party. We are not just all the same. That would be horrible and unsound logic. That's how conservatives feel about liberals. So... Feelings have nothing to do with it. There is sometimes only one right and one wrong answer. Republicans have been wrong on a lot of issues lately. Republicans seem to have no morals that they absolutely will stand by anymore. And a lie is a lie it is not an alternative fact. Republicans have been making outrageous and clearly visible lies lately on big things national issues of real consequence. Republicans say that want to repeal and replace Obamacare but they absolutely do not have a replacement. Its a pure lie when they have nothing absolutely nothing to replace it with. About 50% of Americans are conservative. Are you willing to say that about half of American citizens are completely immoral? They are your fellow Americans. Here is a better breakdown of how people will eventually vote. Notice there is a huge number of people who who do not identify with a Party. Just saying these people could always switch over in 2020 and produce a huge blue wave like 2018.31% of American identify as Democrats and 24% identify as Republicans. The largest block identify as 42% independents. The right believes the left is wrong. You really don't seem to understand what is going on here and it is hilarious. I understand. So that means you do not understand. ROFL. Oh you poor silly bastard. Wokeass merkley Horrible idea. It's part of our government for a reason. I know many of you will disagree with me... that being said abolishing the electoral college is a terrible idea. Without it rural America has no voice in US politics and all federal policy would be catered toward populous cities. Michigan is a top 10 State in terms of number of electoral votes but the candidate for the Democratic Party never campaigned there in 2016. So it’s not like they are catering towards electoral votes now. To be quite honest I would still rather that the majority of the population decides who becomes our president. Yes rural states deserve a say in things but we are actively disenfranchising incredibly large amounts of our population but not making their votes count or matter due to the electoral college. It’s a balancing act. The thing is large populations do have their voice heard. Populous states have significantly more electoral votes than small states. Additionally the electoral college protects us from tyranny of the majority faction. It’s not perfect but I think eliminating it would be a huge mistake. Thats a valid point. Perhaps there is another solution we are missing to make it more proportional.,0,False,t3_b7akzb,70,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/b7akzb/dem_senator_introduces_bill_to_abolish_electoral/,571,,Dem senator introduces bill to abolish Electoral College,571,https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/436469-dem-senator-introduces-bill-to-abolish-electoral-college

Cross that line MF It was not 'made up'.Asked by Times reporters Michael Schmidt and Maggie Haberman about whether an investigation into Trump's finances would be a breach of a ""red line"" Trump answered ""I would say yeah.""Then he followed with a rambling speech about how successful he is and that the Russians he knows are 'nice people'.When asked how he would respond if Mueller 'crossed that line' he said:""I can't answer that question because I don't think it's going to happen"" he said.Your right in that while Trump kind of limply acknowledged it he did concur that it IS a red line. He IS the US president and everything he says is important. The NYT may have laid a trap for him that he stepped in and they keep reminding us of it. That is his fault. He agreed with the comment.Anyway Trump's finances SHOULD NOT be off limits to US citizens.

Trump has an effective style that unscrupulous people will emulate.It has very little to do with Trump.There are reality manipulation campaigns being executed on a global scale by those who want to see power consolidated by a global criminal oligarchy and it's not just Russian intelligence. Cambridge Analytica is still operated by the Mercer family under a different name and they've been supported by mercenary intelligence gathering organizations like Palantir and it's venture capitalist owner and Trump supporter Peter Thiel.This is not about the style of a wannabe dictator but about budgets greater than the GDP of most countries being used to leverage mass data gathering analysis of behavior models and social media influencing to create an alternative reality supporting that global oligarchy.Agree that this is now the norm. Any idea that politics is about platform and policy are hilariously naive. True. The true failure is the system that allowed Trump to be a viable candidate in the first place. Trump is a face to the problem but the problem had been there all along.... I’m sure that they’ll try but not everyone will be as effective at creating a cult following like Donald has.  Plus eventually people will wise up to these tricks and they’ll have to think up new ones.

We're the one's that fucked up by choosing not to vote.What's this we shit? Exactly.Get the fuck out there on election day.Given the poll numbers right now 60% of us think he sucks. That's a twenty point lead.Hopefully that's enough but a third party candidate could fuck it up. So could Democratic leadership.I think whoever is the head of the ticket Pete Budedgedge or however it's spelled would be the perfect contrast to Fuckface Pence as veep. I hope YOU have learned YOUR lesson. I wasn't one of those people. I was screaming at the top of my damned lungs not to underestimate Trump. Meanwhile everyone else I knew stayed home and just assumed Hillary would win by default.So I have no lesson to learn. Everyone else needs to catch up with people like me and be more involved. Then why the we? I'm talking on general political demographics ""We"". Democrats as a whole had a really irresponsibly low turn out given how many of us there are out there. So as a party ""We"" dropped the ball. Too many of us the left party did not turn up to vote.Likewise independents (who I see tend to still lean left anyways) insisted on splitting votes at a time when it was way more important to vote for someone that would actually beat Trump and not put us in the situation we're in now. Well the way things are going it will be over once Trump locks us all up at this point. Why are there over 300 pages of details about something that didn't happen? Ah well see it's all made up ... and meticulously cross-checked and was sufficient to get 34 people indictedBut it's totally a hoax The big problem for me is of it was an illegitimate/fake investigation - a witch hunt if you will - how has it failed to nail its target? Because somehow Trump fought it off!  But don't look at the details coz he fought it off by covering it up. Black Mirror the insights of the entire show is impressive. trumps standard defence tactic to accuse the opposition of what you are doing.Did you do that? no you did it! just like a five year old.

davidreiss666,It’s difficult to distance oneself from their own shadow. If he did his rallies would be empty You’re actually an idiot. Where did you get “fully agree all non-whites should die?” That’s a massive extrapolation that’s more of just a straw man and ad hominem than anything else. It’s insulting to anyone that’s actually trying to take politics and debate seriously. When? Where? That’s the kind of statement that you need substantiating proof for. Look man I hate Trump as much as the next guy but if you hate someone you should hate them for the right reasons. Making unfounded guesses as to massive accusations like that really aren’t valuable. If you can find a quote somewhere that substantiates this then I’ll shut up; otherwise you should rethink your approach to politics. No you need to have provable assertions. Now you’re just distancing yourself from the fact that you can’t prove that Trump wants the death of all non-whites. Provable assertions are a pipe dream.  He talks like a mobster and you want to insist upon we adhere to  Parliamentary Debate style? Of course he wants all non-white people to die. Again prove it. Show me something that even remotely justifies that statement. Why?  You think you deserve some retort to your pantywaisted snivelling whimpering?  You are obviously not paying attention to the new rule book bitch. The same rules still apply to actual debate. Now stop evading the question and give me proof.

progress18,"God I loathe this woman. She is a fucking cartoon villain. Everything she does and says makes her seem like a parody and it is beyond insane that she is in power I want to let her do it. She couldn't answer an elected rep. on how many kids that would affect. The elected rep. being an educated person did their homework prior to the meeting and new the answer. 280000 kids. It is time to give the american people some tough love. Let the Republicans win on what they want to do. Let her cut it. Parents of 280K kids will suddenly have that pulled from under them. Maybe they will wake up and realize Republicans are only out for the super wealthy and in no way whatsoever here for anyone else. Let them win let the people suffer. let them cancel obamacare. It is counter intuitive but yes let them burn the house down. Then simply go on the road and say I told you this would happen to you and they are the ones that did it. Do you want us to fix it? Or do you want the house to continue to burn? Here's the problem...a large section of Republican constituents would be PERFECTLY OK with this happening as long as it didn't happen to their own kids.  So I don't think it would cause the backlash you seem to believe it would. Republican constituents would be PERFECTLY OK with this happening""These people won't ever be productive members of society so why are we spending tax money on them to play games?""There are definitely elements of the Republican base that if born in 1920's would be in full support of eugenics. The kids shot at Newtown could have been productive members of society per Republican constituent (and leadership) thinking but that didn't stop them either. Elements of the base would be pretty fucking surprised to find out that eugenics 2.0 in America includes euthanizing the poor. I think the kids in Newtown were solidly middle class definitely not poor.  I fault the Republicans more for refusing to acknowledge we need better healthcare especially mental healthcare in this country.I fault the Democrats for playing the gun control card when no amount of gun control would have stopped the tragedy.  The time to have stopped it was years before by getting the shooter and possibly his mom help. Oh sorry - I wasn't clear. Yeah the kids in Newtown were middle class. What I meant was that a lot of the Republican base is poor and they'd be shocked to learn the wealthy elites are okay with wiping them out.I disagree about the gun control but totally agree about better health care. Neither the shooter nor his mother should ever have been allowed to possess firearms and they should have been subject to a mental wellness intervention way sooner in life. I'm generally anti-gun but I myself have a long history of hospitalizations for mental illness and I freely admit even though I'm not violent that I should be on the list of people who should never be allowed to own firearms. no amount of gun control would have stopped the tragedyI'm sorry what? Are you drunk?  How about a ban on all personal use of guns for other than legitimate militias (i.e. national guards) and hunting with hunting rifles being owned by the state and only loaned for limited periods to mentally stable individuals???  I.e. a US solution that looks like an actual first world country but preserves our ""precious"" second amendment rights and the only other legitimate use of guns.Or goddamn just a private solution of requiring liability insurance could arguably have stopped this.  Gun control of any real substance absolutely would have stopped those babies from being slaughtered. guns for other than legitimate militias (i.e. national guards)The national guard is the military not a militia.  Stop trying to redefine words.  Hunting has absolutely nothing to do with the 2nd amendment.  You can not just show up at a national guard post and volunteer to serve duty.Or goddamn just a private solution of requiring liability insurance could arguably have stopped this.Like insurance has solved drunk driving accidents.  Right.You clearly have this figured out. Yeah let's just continue to do absolutely nothing.Thoughts and prayers!!! Or fund nationalizes healthcare and vastly improve mental healthcare to Americans.You realize most gun deaths are suicides right?  I didn't say do nothing.  I just think banning guns is a nonproductive way to solve the problem.  But downvote away. Yep will continue to downvote that's the coward's answer.  Guns need to be stopped.  No one is safe in a society with guns in it.  End of.  I don't understand why anyone thinks that all the mental health in the world will fix this-- if everyone had a personal therapist and still had access to guns this would still happen.  Might be less might be harder but assholes exist no matter how much therapy there is in the world.  People kill themselves with guns all the time while in therapy and/or on anti-depressants.  Be realistic.  Guns kill people because people have guns around.I absolutely agree that our mental health infrastructure is woefully inadequate.  It's a bandaid solution for the gun problem we have though. Also WTH do you think a well regulated militia even is?  If the founders were alive today they'd be completely horrified that they split that sentence the way they did.  And they'd be disgusted with what we've done to their republic.  Let's all have a little bravery common sense and a strong dose of realism like they had. Regulated at the time means maintained or supplied. What did militia mean?  At the time it meant a government sanctioned posse cobbled together by the governor to put down a rebellion.Sounds like a national guard to me. Yeah but that'd mean these Republican voters understood cause and effect. As much as I sympathize the problem is that that has real tangible effects on real people. Lifelong if not life-and-death effects on real people. I volunteered for many years at the special Olympics. It's a great cause but would be privately funded in a heartbeat if we stopped using tax dollars. I think this creature is even more evil than her brother. Her brother?

walter1950,Tax cuts come at a cost. So does free college and more social welfare programs. But those actually have benefits for society as a whole. They’re not just policy based on greed. Well they have benefits for the portion of society that receives them not the whole society. I would argue that it benefits even those that don’t receive it by improving other’s quality of life. Crime impacts all of society and crime and poverty go hand-in-hand. I suppose this is debatable but it how I feel. That’s a fair point but just because you’re on welfare doesn’t mean you’re suddenly not impoverished sadly. Very true. I think we need to rethink welfare in this country which includes incentivizing people to work if they’re able. I had a friend who’s sister did not work because she’s actually get less money then if she just stayed on welfare. That seems pretty silly IMO!

Brocktoon_in_a_jar,I've always thought the map shown in the picture was very disingenuous. Makes you think the country is 95% Republican. The truth is that most of the population are in cities in the blue areas while a vast expanse of the red area is mostly jackrabbits and coyotes. Disingenuous is the kindest way to describe that meaningless map. fwiw the map in the article is the 3D version that shows population by height. Spoiler: lots of blue rectangles.The crux of the article is simply how and why to make those blue rectangles taller in red and purple state metros. I saw it. It still gives the impression that the US is more republican than it is. The 3D aspect doesn't have the impact it is supposed to. yeah whenever conservatives try to use that map to gloat i ask them how many votes the Mojave desert and rocky mountains get. whatever you say Mr. Totally An American Interesting comment from someone who’s posted the exact same comment a dozen times.He love sucking this country dry and he’s enabled by ignorants like you.

DRdefective,For one it’s a non-profit. That’s a good start they have no one to be loyal to but themselves. Second it’s a wire service. So it tends to be straight reporting of the facts. Their job is to report the facts on any given news story and then your news org is welcome to add comment and spin. Yeah I definitely like the fact that they are independent. Does being a wire service mean that other news orgs pay them for facts? It's a pretty standard no-nonsense organization similar to NPR.

mysteryman151,Just watched a few of these videos - definitely worth your time.  Good stuff well done. Shortly after it was released I watched the one on them being bad faith debaters and instantly recognized the entirety of the lead up to the 2016 elections and frankly that's all I needed to see from this channel. I mean it's probably a great channel and people should support it but I just don't need to know anything beyond the fact that there's no point in engaging them at all. Just focus on convincing the independents and non-voters that being engaged can fix this shit show. There’s more to it than how to debate with themIt’s more about understanding them and recognising why they act or think the way they do which in turn helps to guide people away from them and best of all helps you identify when someone is already too far gone Thank you for this! I recently posted a question about getting along with my conservative coworkers and wound up getting mostly backlash and not a lot of helpful comments. I’ve been trying to understand conservative motivations better and this was really helpful.

deabeatdad,Maybe I’m misunderstanding but the difference between racial ideology and racial identity seems to be a distinction without a difference.The last paragraph of the article “What this all shows is that America isn’t racially divided it’s divided by racial ideology. And that’s a good thing for the country’s unity because ideological differences however lamentable are less polarizing than racial conflict in which whole communities mobilize against an enemy. A mix of races are found in each racial ideology preventing tribe and creed from pushing in the same direction which might lead to civil conflict. This raises the hope that American political elites can one day heal the country’s divisions.”Nazism is clearly an ideology but it still resulted in the Holocaust.

Flowers4Harambe,"I kind of agree everyone hates each other at this point. Its getting worse and worse I honestly think the US should just break up. California being its own country would be fantastic. California Nevada Hawaii Washington would be amazing. Joining Canada would be a dream.Federal politics just don't seem sustainable they used to pretend to try to get along and had some joint efforts that is long gone. I see no reason to get rid of the fed there are many issues that we as a country can mostly agree upon. Our military for example is something that we benefit from sharing. Our federal agencies that fight organized crime. Agencies that regulate businesses definitely need to be federal well-funded and appropriatel powerful (not easily bullied by corporate interests.) Overall our country is still pretty good and worth keeping intact. But I'd be ok with a compromise of continuing with our existing fed while we try out progressive economic approaches in a coalition of states. The issue is the amount of dollars spent on federal tax dollars which much of it goes towards subsidization of states that hate us with completely opposing values and politics with no sign of it getting better. Even the current tax bill was weaponized against blue states who have less voting power and representation per capita. Now you can't even implement your own tax policy in states because it means you are taxed twice on the same income since there is now a cap on state and local tax deductions.I don't see much hope of this getting better any time soon it has become ""your vote is worth less than ours and thats how it should be and you owe more money than us and get less back"". I'd be perfectly happy with a military coalition for defense but beyond that what point is there at this point? I think state investigators would be fine. Agree that the new Trump SALT cap is a huge thorn in the side of my idea (brought to us by the party of ""states rights"" thanks guys.)But do conservative voters strongly back that new cap? Seems like an opposition movement could get bipartisan support.And just to repeat a point I made in another comment I'm definitely not advocating for reducing federal regulatory power or funding. This is specifically about new federal social programs like those that are being proposed by our 2020 Dem candidates. > But do conservative voters strongly back that new cap? Seems like an opposition movement could get bipartisan support.In my eyes conservative voters strongly back things that ""hurt"" democrats removing the cap would further raise the deficit(they put those things in there to stop the bleeding on the tax cuts and put the bleeding into blue states).> And just to repeat a point I made in another comment I'm definitely not advocating for reducing federal regulatory power or funding. This is specifically about new federal social programs like those that are being proposed by our 2020 Dem candidates.I of course support those policies but I think unless we remove the electoral college I have no confidence we will win in 2020 and I have no confidence even if we do win that those polices will stay around until the next republican comes to remove them. The divisiveness is unprecedented we have lower class people voting against their own interests and in favor of the interests of the richest in the country there is no way that is stopping any time soon. I just think at some point the country is so split it would be beneficial for both sides to break up.On your point of trying these social programs in blue states is the difficulty comes from having to pay so much in federal taxes with no way to not be double taxed now on state taxes. They literally cut us in the achilles heel to try what you are saying. If you impose a tax for universal healthcare in California it will now be taxed twice. I see that Trump extremists buy into the ""hurt the Libs"" mentality but I doubt that the moderates and Libertarians do. The SALT cap is an increase in federal taxes which they should fundamentally oppose and not all Republican voters live in states with no income tax.But let's look at it a little closer: Currently the cap is at $10k meaning that it mainly affects people making over 100k. That actually plays pretty well into the Dem movement of ""tax the wealthy"" but maybe a bit better if it were adjusted to 20k or 30k? I think there should be no cap money shouldn't be taxed twice. It creates a situation that is unfair when they lower marginal rates and cap gains rates and create these caps it means upper middle class(let's face is 100k in the bay is In no way ""wealthy"") and lower marginal rates means really rich people who don't care about the write-off pay millions less taxes and people in the 100k range but under a million pay more because of the cap change and losing their write-offs. It also means the state has less incentive to be able to have their own taxes.I'm fine with higher rates but it needs to be fair people richer than me don't get to pay less while I pay more it would need to be marginally taxed based on income.And you are gonna have a hard time convincing me that pretty.much all the republican party isn't Trump ""extremists"" he has 90% approval rating in the party. I knew some people who were not particularly political that voted for him simply because ""wanna keep your money? Vote R.""Seems like there are likely a whole bunch of those types who make over 100k and will be affected by the cap. If someone were to point out to them that they just lost thousands to the IRS every year in perpetuity thanks to Trump's ""tax break""... they might not vote for him in 2020. Only 7 states don't have income tax and one of them is home to Amazon and Microsoft and votes blue af. Honestly if your plan is to get these people to vote democrat good luck I don't see it happening. I have no plan this [my OP] is just something that stuck out at me as a plot-hole in reality and I can't help but pick at it. Cool as long as red states tax money stayed in red states. That's kind of the point... red states are already at a net negative so not much would change for those states. They just wouldn't pay into or get the benefits of blue-coalition social programs.I mean wasn't this country founded on ""you try your ideas we'll try ours"" compromises? I'm all for it. Blue states are AWESOME at fiscal responsibility. Just look at Michigan and Illinois. I'm all for helping out struggling areas of our country with financial stimulus at the consumer level. These are the low hanging fruit of things we can do to strengthen our economy. CA and NY can have their backs. With the rate of people who are exiting high tax states such as New York and California would it really be sustainable? I keep seeing this statement about California but all proof I've seen so far is about a particular segment of the population and mostly has to do with cost of living. Meanwhile the economy and population continues to grow (albeit slowly at less than 1%).Regardless CA would be able to potentially reduce the overall tax rate administering it's own programs as it would keep a greater percentage of federal taxes it would generate. Even conceding the fact that California is experiencing a growth do you really think that it would be enough to offset the net losses in states like Illinois Michigan and all those small little new England states with barely any tax income?  Would it offset the loss of tax revenue from states like Texas and pretty much the entire southeast US? Southeast? Alabama and Mississippi are two of the most federally dependent states when looking at ratio of dependent to contribution although I would think their total Federal aid to be smaller than Michigan. Illinois is one of the least dependent with Connecticut and Massachusetts not far behind.California is the fifth largest economy in the world so it might offset Michigan and a few other losing blue states. Now I'm not saying it's a good idea but an interesting thought exercise. Correct me if I'm wrong but isnt Illinois damn near bankrupt? Oh no its budget is in terrible condition. But it's in a similar situation in Federal tax contribution vs dependency as California. There would be more in taxes coming into the state than theoretical cost it consumes in Federal benefits assuming all costs to provide the social programs remain the same if the state administered it.It would help with it's situation somewhat I would expect. Then again maybe the state's deficit will be too large for it to matter? Minnesota is “blue” and doing just fine thank you very much. We also have some of the best outcomes for children and women. Well I heard a segment about this on NPR and I think such a thing which might be satisfying a little in a Schadenfreude or just desserts way isn't really what we want. The Democratic party is trying to reach people in all 50 states. Let's stop dividing the country into concepts of red and blue states if it implies we don't try to reach anyone outside of ""blue"". What about swing states? What about the Republican rural parts of blue states like Illinois and California that are only blue because of their cities? We should be trying hard as it is to reach all people including people who have traditionally been Republican. So it would be satisfying but Petty and undermining our long-term goals. It's working for marijuana legalization. Why do we have to force our ideals on all 50 states when some don't want it? Why not start with those who do want it and let the rest learn from our example?

This is an opportunity to win this bullshit ""civil war"" they're so hyped to fight just by starving them of cash while at the same time placating them with a perceived win. (This only works if we also cut corporate welfare. Hold them to that Fiscal Conservatism.)

They struck it down for the wrong reasons though. The session where all of the activity that stripped his powers was not a normally scheduled session that was done by the procedure outlined in the states constitution. Everything done during that session was rendered null & void but will be appealed and will most likely be overturned. Either way all states need to amend their constitutions to put a window on when such changes are made. For instance you can make changes to these powers in the first year after an election. After that you must wait until after the next election to make changes.If I were the gov i would just use emergency powers and say the Republican party is affiliated with foreign enemies (Thanks Jared et al) and define them as a terrorist organization and ban them from holding office in the state.

I'm sure that's not the answer you were hoping for since people like you thrive on hatred.

LizaBerlin,"Just try not to place so much importance in people’s political beliefs... That’s exactly what I’m hoping for advice on. It’s easier said than done- I’m trying to block out the memory of her post on Facebook that blatantly supports white nationalism while I’m listening to her talk about her weekend plans with her family. How do you reconcile that? honestly it's kinda weird to talk about politics at work or in social settings. don't argue or allow yourself to get worked up about it just change the subject. after all they're just your coworkers. you don't have to be best friends with them. politics don't make or break a person's character IMO It can be hard especially when you have to listen to nonsense and just grit your teeth but that’s what I’d advise you to do. There’s no percentage in trying to use reason with righties. It just doesn’t work. Years ago I had a job where I had to go to prosecutors offices to work on the computers and literally every single one of them had someone with an AM radio tuned to Rush Limbaugh playing all day. They’d nod their head along and talk about how awful the liberals were and I’d have to just keep my mouth shut and ignore it. Luckily I wasn’t stuck there every day - I did my thing and got out. If I did have to listen to that daily I’d invest in a good pair of noise cancelling headphones and just drown it out with some music or a podcast. Nothing has been direct and it’s not a constant barrage of conservative rhetoric but we definitely have different opinions on things like the possible abolishment of the electoral college in our state and the impending grocery store union strike. Its not terrible this is just new to me. Thank you for your advice! First political conversation I say “I don’t talk politics at work”. This just say you don't like dragging politics into the work place. Or just tell them you keep out of political discussions and don't follow politics much. Political anonymity in professionalism is not just functional for a work environment it's functional for Democracy.  Owners and bosses used to force employees to vote their way or get fired.  It's more than just a good thing it's a necessity in our society.  They should understand this.  Also don't only hang with people who think exactly like you do all the time.  The probability to learn plummets. You make such a good point- maybe I should be looking at this in a more positive light I’m being exposed to new ideas and new lifestyles. Thank you for your comment! Become a master of changing the subject. If your coworker gets onto politics say you think the politician made a bid on some famous sports team and start talking about that instead. Keep in mind they are probably saying the same thing about you. Yea for sure. I guess my ideal result would just be for us to acknowledge and respect each other’s differences but it seems like the standard approach is to act oblivious. Politics shouldn’t have a place at work.  It’s unprofessional.   I’d kindly remind them of that. So you're struggling with things like:""These people DON'T like to kill babies?""""These people actually OWN guns?""""These people feel there are more ILLEGALS coming in than is necessary?""""These awful people go to CHURCH!

KubrickIsMyCopilot,"I suspect she thinks that Trump as President damages the GOP's 2020 chances far more than Pence as President would. Anyone who thinks Trump can't win in 2020 is even more disconnected from reality than Trump himself is. No one thought he'd get past the GOP primaries and yet he did. No one thought he'd become the nominee and yet he did. No one thought he'd win in the general and several high profile progressive made humorous (at the time) and gleeful pronouncements about how great it would be for Hillary if he was the nominee - and then he went on to win. He can and very well might win again in 2020 and guess what? The Dems refusing to impeach him could be enough of an argument for him to claim this really was a witchunt and now he'll have Pelosi's own statements to back it up. That's basically the argument used now to rehabilitate W - ""Well if he broke the law why wasn't he impeached?"". If she believes that she's delusional for all the reasons stated in the OP.  Trump was an openly racist treasonous monster in 2016 and he's an openly racist treasonous monster now.  The difference is that Russia has direct control of American federal institutions now which it didn't in 2016.There's not going to be an election in 2020 if Trump is still in power.  It would be a coronation undertaken to the sound of the Russian national anthem. Here's my take Pelosi doesn't want to proceed with the articles of impeachment at this point because at this point there is not enough sufficient proof that Trump violated the law to convince the Republican Senate to actually vote to impeach him. If the house were to go ahead with the vote it passes goes to the Senate and gets struck down it might make future attempts to impeach Trump more difficult even in the face of new evidence or allegations.I feel like Trump is calling for Muller's report to be made public not only as a false posture of strength but also because the noose is really tightening in on Trump. If the report were made public right now Trump might have just enough wiggle room to escape indictment and impeachment. I also feel like if this were to happen it would make other investigations into Trump's affairs like devaluing assets to evade taxes lose some public support and really rile up the propaganda machines for the upcoming election.Overall it's not that Pelosi is actively defending Trump. She's a politician playing politics. If we weren't so entrenched in party over country politics the proceedings would probably already be taking place. However we live in a time where the president can pay a pornstar for sex while his wife is pregnant with his child and still get the overwhelming support of the evangelical vote. Unfortunately for the democratic politicians they have to impatiently wait for Mueller's findings to come out and hope that there is enough public outcry that republican senators start worrying about their job security in future elections if they don't support impeachment. When that happens republicans will (hopefully) jump ship.Am I happy about it? No. Do I understand it? Yes. Pelosi doesn't want to proceed with the articles of impeachment at this point because at this point there is not enough sufficient proof that Trump violated the law to convince the Republican SenateThe Republican Senate knows he's guilty because it's accomplice to his crimes so it's not a matter of ""convincing"" them.  What they can be made to do is abandon him if it's made into a sufficiently stark choice between that or losing their own seats not to mention having criminal justice scrutiny of their own vast repertoire of felonies.If the house were to go ahead with the vote it passes goes to the Senate and gets struck down it might make future attempts to impeach Trump more difficult even in the face of new evidence or allegations.Every moment that the House doesn't proceed with impeachment Trump is literally a dictator and the authority of Congress is fictional.  The ""it might not work"" argument doesn't make any sense when there's no other option that isn't tantamount to total surrender of American liberty and law.Overall it's not that Pelosi is actively defending Trump. She's a politician playing politics.Yes and no.  She is a politician who thinks everything is just a fun little dinner party game but at the moment she thinks her precious ""campaign strategy"" involves defending Trump from her own party and country - neither of which have a future if he is still in power a year from now.Pelosi is delusional on a level that would make Chamberlain or Petain blush.Unfortunately for the democratic politicians they have to impatiently wait for Mueller's findings to come out and hope that there is enough public outcry that republican senators start worrying about their job security in future elections if they don't support impeachment.They do have to make Republicans worried for their seats but that can only come from pursuing impeachment - not passively waiting for external factors to give them permission to do it.Impeaching Trump is literally their job.  It's right there in the Oath of Office and in the Constitution.  And it's not optional if they intend to be anything more than be denounced by history as the cowardly midwives of tyranny who stood passively by as their nation was dismantled. She’s not defending Trump. Nowhere in what you quoted is she even hinting at defending him.But you do realize that impeachment is just a step in the process? He would have to be convicted by the Senate to be removed from office and we all know that Republicans are not brave enough to support conviction. If they were per Pelosi’s quote you would not be wasting your time and impeachment would be worth pursuing.Right now their efforts are best focused on continuing to identify all of the corruption that Trump and co have added to our government agencies so that when Trump is removed from office—either through conviction or election—the other MAGAts that he brought with him will also be held to account. She’s not defending Trump. Nowhere in what you quoted is she even hinting at defending him.Read the quote again: She essentially dismissed her own party and voting base as unfair partisan hypocrites for simply aiming to defend the country from a terrorist dictator while pointedly claiming Trump had been ""elected.""It's not possible to overstate how delusional the premises of her statement are.But you do realize that impeachment is just a step in the process?Indeed and neither the step nor the process are optional.He would have to be convicted by the Senate to be removed from officeThen we have to make sure they do that don't we?we all know that Republicans are not brave enough to support conviction.But definitely cowardly enough to abandon a fellow accomplice when the writing is on the wall.We just have to write it first. Impeachement is not a legal proceeding.  It is a political one.  And if you shoot for the king you cannot miss.Nancy has more political experience than anyone on reddit..combined.  If she is saying impeachment would distract the country and give Trump political cover for more fuckery...all the while resulting in no conviction...then I trust her. Impeach Trump you get Pence and with Pence all those conservatives who are on the edge with Trump love Pence they see him as a moral Christian who looks and acts Presidential Republicans Know this they will ride it out just until the end then drop the hammer. We have a Constitution for a reason.  And if Pence breaks the law - which he would - then we impeach him too. This was precisely the reason I was against her regaining the speakership. She did the same thing in 2007 with W who clearly had violated the law with Iraq and warrant less wiretapping. Frankly those crimes seem almost quaint now in the Trump era. If we're lucky we'll be rid of Trump in 2021 but very clearly he'll get away with all of this with no consequences and nothing will change to prevent it from happening again.

&gt; ""You're wasting your time unless the evidence is so conclusive that the Republicans will understand"" Pelosi D-Calif. told USA TODAY.   

Got that?  Democrats are somehow being *partisan* and *unfair* to Trump according to her and the Constitution is a waste of time unless Republicans give her permission to do her job - a job **she only has in the first place because American voters ignored her advice.**  

And she says this crap just a few days after Trump parroted the Nazi terrorists in NZ reminding us all that he has also incited Nazi mass-murderers in this country - and likely will continue doing so with impunity every moment that he holds power.  Pelosi is now actively *publicly* defending a treasonous terrorist-inciting white supremacist dictator against her own party and country.  

You may remember in 2018 that Pelosi had denounced the voter revolt that put her into the Speakership as ""uncivil"" and responded to a wave of American disgust with Republicans by vowing ""bipartisanship"" as leader of the House of Representatives - the chamber of Congress that is *meant* by its very design to be contentious and (get this) *representative*.  

The most charitable interpretation left at this point is that she's a delusional millionaire living in her own little world of collegial DC politics who would still be chasing ~~peace in our time~~ ""bipartisanship"" with Russpublican tanks rolling down the street and Glorious Leader Trumpsky reviewing them from a balcony in a fur hat.  

It is almost indisputable at this point: Nancy Pelosi has clearly forgotten what country this is what party she claims to belong to and the most basic Constitutional duties of her job even just as an ordinary member of Congress - let alone Speaker of the House.

In fiscal 2018 the number was 50036.""https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/02/immigration-crisis-fact-check-916924""It’s true there were more border arrests in 2018 than in 2017 a development that prompted Trump to level blistering criticism against Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen and that led Attorney General Jeff Sessions to impose — without consulting DHS — the “zero-tolerance” border arrest policy that led to last spring’s surge in family separations.But in 2017 border arrests had dropped to a historic low; to find a year with fewer border arrests you have to go back all the way to 1971. Indeed a September 2017 report by the Department of Homeland Security was able to boast — somewhat inconveniently as Trump sought to secure funding for a wall along the southern border — that “the southwest land border is more difficult to illegally cross today than ever before.”This is all ignoring the fact that walls dont fucking work.

The problem is Obama would never ask for a fucking border wall because he’s not a racist Mexican hating prick. He also doesn’t think like a third-grader. The wall is a third-grader’s solution to the problem. It’s laughable. Agreed. Context matters. Obama never made racially charged accusations against mexican and south american people. He never called for a muslim ban. He never called those countries shithole nations.If Obama called for a wall on the southern border we'd say ""I guess we really need a wall on the southern border."" because Obama has credibility and people trust that when he says something should be done he's put thought into it and that thought comes from a place of wanting what's best for not just the American people but the world as a whole.

Well there's also the blowback effect to consider: the possibility that the efforts to make border crossing more tedious or restricted is actually driving people to stay here permanently without authorization instead of just staying temporarily as the need arises (especially migrant workers).

FridayNightFreedom,"Steve King doesn't realize what side Iowa was on during the real Civil War either. Not really worried about threats from a pipsqueak Neo NAZI or his army of morbidly obese type 2 diabetic rascal scooter bound chickenhawks. “The south will rise again.”“Bitch you can’t rise up that flight of stairs with your rascal scooter ass.” And yet he'll still get re-elected for some reason. The reason is racism. The reason is the R next to his name. The knuckle draggers in his district would rather elect a racist than a Democrat. I've spent a bit of time in that district.  If you turn too fast your swinging dick will hit a church.  I'll bet if you ran someone super religious who has actual integrity you could win at this point. I'm not so sure. Many can't wrap their mind around anything but guns and abortion So give them a candidate they can like.  Is there a rule that says there can't be a democrat who doesnt want to make abortion easier?  I get that it's against the grain - generally nationally - but fuck.  Give them an alternative to this prick they can vote for. It's not that easy. It's pretty much a litmus test for both parties Then I guess wake me when they're willing to win. ""Let'em out so I kin shoot'em later!"" I'm more concerned that they are electing an idiot...dude doesn't even seem to be aware what state he represents (i.e. a strictly union anti-slavery state) How's that peace in our time ""bipartisanship"" that Speaker Pelosi keeps talking about coming along with Nazi trash like Steve King speaking for the zeitgeist on the other side? Or Pennsylvania and West Virginia? Checking in from WV they sure fucking don’t ! Rebel flags everywhere and they get real angry when they try to change any monuments related to the confederacy. Exactly I use to work up there and Pennsylvania and I’ve seen more confederate flags up there than in my native Louisiana. I’m like y’all were on the right side of the war. Your state broke off of Virginia to be on the right side of the war. So what you’re saying is that just like every other geriatric republican boomer on Facebook he shared a meme without fully understanding what was on it? Shocking. The stupid spreads far and wide like wild fire with these people. Probably because Steve King is a moron...and Iowa should stop having morons represent them. 👍 The next civil war won't be North v South. It'll be Rural vs. Urban. These fucking nazis in our gov have got to go. I wish there were a way we could see his brain so we could study it in order to find out just what the hell is wrong with him. He made a disturbing point though that rings true that they have the guns. I actually think that's just part of their propaganda. Just like ""You're either for the wall or open borders."" and ""You're either pro-life or a baby-killer.""Liberals are not anti-gun. They're in favor of reasonable restrictions that would help keep them out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them and stop or restrict the sale of guns that make it easy to kill 30 people in 15 seconds.It kind of sucks that some people who would otherwise vote liberal buy into the propaganda because they love their guns so I wish we could counter the propaganda in some way.But if it really came down to a left vs right civil war I think the right might be surprised at just how many guns there are on the left. And I'll take that as an advantage. Know what we have? Engineers who know how to make weapon systems & the factories to mass produce those weapon systems.Cletus is never even going to see me when my drone kills him as he holds his precious 30-06.

progress18,"My er favorite Donald Trump quote of all time:""We're fighting a very politically correct war.  The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families.  When you get these terrorists you have to take out their families.  They care about their lives don't kid yourself when they say they don't take about their lives you have to take out their families.""Go ahead click the link listen to him say it for yourself.  Tell other people about it too.That's when he went from being a clown to a real threat in my eyes way back in ye' olde days of 2015 before young Donald had even won the Republican nomination.  Still makes me sick to my stomach to think that's the one campaign promise he's kept. The Bible says those who live by the sword die by the sword. He's never read the Bible and he's not tough enough to fight anyone.  He dies alone in a cell. What I mean by that quote is that the longer he continues stoking violence the odds of suffering the consequences increase. The Secret Service is damn good but they aren't foolproof. I know where you were going.  I doubt most of ""his"" army and police would protect him too... If it ever came down to it. Well I don't want to find out. A lot of innocent people would get hurt or killed in the process. True.  I think most of the GOP would have to find a spine before anything really happened. I think the GOP has proved they have a spine.  They have backed him no matter what.  When I hear Pelosi say things like impeachment isn't worth it it makes me question the left's spine more.  If any President would be impeached...it's him. Pelosi knows they don't have the votes in the Senate.  Dems have a great momentum from the last election in the house and are making good progress turning red states purple in the senate.  There's not enough time to impeach Trump before 2020.  She probably thinks it's safer for a number of democrats not to have to answer questions about Trump's impeachment going into an election year.  Don't get me wrong.  I'ld love to see him impeached.  And by a spine....I didn't mean backing Donny T.  I meant standing up for America. Unlike criminal charges impeachment can be brought up multiple times.  The correct action the house should be taking is to vote for impeachment.  The Democrats are shooting themselves in the foot once again. They still need the Republicans to support and vote for impeachment.  Every time they call for impeachment and fail...it will only strengthen Donny T's base.  They are desperate for wins and the GOP senators could easily give it to them.  I understand where you are coming from I just dont think they can pull it off in time.  Unless Mueller's report has some huge bombshells the GOP can't word away.  At this point I'd be surprised if there is anything that could sway his base or the Senate Republican support. Thinking Trump will face consequences for anything he's done is pretty delusional. You must be great at parties Check the user name.  My life's a party. Well... we already missed a golden opportunity.The Ides Of March. Just seeing Trump's face makes me violent...and I really hate that that is my reaction. Anyone at this point who stands in the way of his impeachment and removal from power should be denounced as an appeaser of Nazi terrorism. And it's time to protest his violence mongering Be honest the most protesting you’ll do is upvote reddit posts Nothing you said is true. Behold the result of years of breathing Trump's ass fumes...so sad so so sad :( If you dont see the kinds of things trump says that oncites violence then you just might be part of the problem. If you think America doesnt have a race problem you are either racist yourself or blissfully ignorant. As a model minority asian american born and raised in this country i am more american than most but even I am still discriminated against. Sometimes it isnt with ill intentions but prejudices still exist. If I am asian am I automatically good at math bad at driving and obedient? Not really. But i get treated as such. When we have a president who will not vehemently condemn acts of violence and is willing to stick up for the side that causes violence that is what sparks violence because it shows them that their acts of violence toward liberals racial minorities and non trump supporting groups will be accepted.If you dont see what is wrong with Trump in so many ways you are part of the problem. I dont hate you. You are just a result of a lack of higher education financial inequality and racial inequality thatbhas become so normalized. Please really take a moment to logically view the facts and make your own answers.

spaceghoti,"A long read but definitely worth it. My key takeaway is that more and more people aren’t valuing classical liberal values such as inalienable rights and the need for democratic institutions. And countries that have never embraced liberalism like China and Russia are becoming more powerful internationally while also becoming more authoritarian at home. The US is retreating from the world stage and illiberal powers are filling the void.Kagan has a pretty grim world view where Enlightenment principles are not guaranteed to remain dominant world wide and could even fade in classical liberal strongholds like the US.While I’m not as pessimistic as Kagan I think this article is a good reminder that progress is not guaranteed—even over the long term. Anything can happen in the future and we shouldn’t lie to ourselves by pretending that the last few centuries of steady societal progress toward more freedoms and more democracy will continue indefinitely. And a curiously unpopular observation especially in a ""liberal"" subreddit. What is the attraction to some tyrant telling you what to do stealing all your money and threatening your life? As soon as you let them in they declare themselves Dear Leader for life and you never ever get to change your mind.

jonfla,We need a trust buster to break up the oligopolies and cartels in our economy. There is no way back from this other then a systemic failure of our economy and institutions. Make no mistake our government is powerless to make the hard decisions and will be even more so if Trump is in power once those failures begin to occur.The FED has practiced monetary policy knowing full well this failure is coming and rather then take the lumps now they have removed their own weapons to combat poor economic conditions by practicing QE for far too long while leaving interest rates at near zero for too long a period.The problem of course is normalized interest rates means the evaporation of trillions of dollars in real estate liquidity and the potential failure of more banks considered too big to fail.Bottom line:We are one bad day away from being Venezuela. And many businesses are carrying a significant amount of debt on their balance sheets. Many companies like many Americans are so close to bankruptcy if something about their financial situation changes. Fun fact: corporate debt in the US is at nearly half the GDP. You are completely insane. How is this being upvoted? One bad day away from Venezuela? How? Venezuela can’t export its oil. The US economy doesn’t depend on exporting oil. Seriously? That was an exaggeration for the sake of the point We are not as insulated as you think at least from a market crash as bad as 1987 followed by a recession worse than 2008. Right now we are only coasting on positive energy of investors that can change from one bad quarter of results. Probably more than half of America doesn’t even own stocks and has lived paycheck to paycheck on gigs for over a decade now. Recessions don’t matter in a way that “turns us into Venezuela” that’s nonsense. A lot of people won’t even notice a recession. A lot of people don’t even remember 1987’s 20% market drop. And God forbid we build a proper social safety net for when the precious and magical economy has its inevitable crisis or when random bad luck strikes (like when you have to buy insulin but can barely afford it).

Proud3GnAthst,"Right now I’m thinking Elizabeth Warren. She’s got the most consistent socially and economically progressive policies and takes no shit from republican dirt bags.That said I will vote for whoever wins the democratic primary to stop the orange nightmare. What makes her better than Bernie or Tulsi? Don’t know who Tulsi is. Bernie unfortunately left a bad taste in my mouth after 1/10 of his supporters jumped ship for Trump. Frankly I think we’ve had enough of old white guys running the country. (Disclosure: I’m a young white guy) Tulsi Gabbard is the conservative Hawaii congresswoman who was made famous for endorsing Sanders when few others did.  She's an Assad apologist and Russian bots tried really hard to make her Sanders' running mate last time around. Tulsi Gabbard. The young one she's hindu veteran used to have highly conservative (also anti-gay) views but changed her mind. I will vote for Andrew Yang. He has ideas that benefit everyone and really look forward to the oncoming economic and social issues that we as a country haven't been thinking enough about. I will not vote for a democrat but I will vote for a liberal. Bernie checks off literally all my policy desires. I supported him in 2016 and I will support him in 2020.I also like Warren. Her policy to break up Google/Facebook etc is great and I'm watching to see if other Democrats adopt it.I kind of wish either Warren or Bernie would have run but not both as I think they'll split the progressive vote. I want a progressive nominee.Andrew Yang is great too. I'm glad someone is talking about UBI. If my state had ranked-choice voting I'd put him number one but strategically I'm voting for Bernie in the primary.Kamala Harris will have to rectify her tough on crime past to me but I like that she's for M4A and MJ legalization (despite locking up countless people for MJ.)Beto voted with Trump 30% of the time and is against M4A. He's the only Dem that's a 100% no-go for me in the primaries.The other candidates are acceptable to me and are at least relatively progressive compared to Democratic candidates we've had in the past and I see that as progress.I will vote for whoever wins the Democratic nomination in the general election. I'm probably missing something. How can not run both Warren and Bernie? Also what do you think about Tulsi? Do you think she's genuine? She seems as progressive as Warren and Bernie and unlike them she's much fresher which adds to her sympathy-ness. She'd be even younger than Kennedy if she won and assuming she's genuine regarding her change of opinions I like this because it proves that she's open to change and I think this is important. But on the other hand the fact that she is a Hindu could be detrimental to her. How can not run both Warren and Bernie?I was hoping that once Warren announced that Bernie wouldn't run so the progressive vote could solidify behind one candidate.I don't think Gabbard is getting much traction and it is very hard to go from the House directly to the POTUS. So I lumped her in with the other ""acceptable"" candidates. I'm not picky anymore lol. Just an adult and not trump.Harris Biden Booker... even Beto Bernie or Warren. Unless Joe the 3rd changes his mind I'm voting for a young tech dude who wants to fix the Myspace problem. I’m voting for whoever runs against Trump. If I could pick I like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker - it’s a coin toss. Harris is preference because it’s long past time a women become president but would be happy with either. Donald Trump Aren't you liberal? I'm not even American Then what you are and why would you vote for Trump? Liberal politics are a step backwards. Look at the answers to your question. People don't care who they vote for as long as Trump is out of office. This will only end badly for you . You've got it the other way around. It's republicans who always oppose and seek to repeal anything liberal. And those ""steps back"" are nothing but absolutely common practices in every single modern nation. I don't think you understand what I meant No I don't That's ok . Who will you vote for? I'm not American either. But from what I see in America I'd vote for progressive. Bernie would be the best if he weren't as old as Reagan when he left the office.I saw one Secular Talk video according to which Warren is kinda shaddier than Bernie.Ideal would be Tulsi because  she'd be fucking fresh (young woman not a christian) stands for most things Bernie does and she used to be conservative and bigoted against gays but grew out of it which implies she's open to changes. I consider this a virtue.Yang sounds good too.

everetterice,Not sure about the part saying “the Greatest Generation tried its best to scour from the earth” this type of racist ideology. That generation came back to Jim Crow America and blithely pretty much ignored things until the Civil Rights Movement thrust it to the forefront. They sure didn’t seem to do much about entrenched anti-Semitism here either. Scouring from Europe doesn’t count as “the earth” folks. I guess hence the article title but still... Excellent points My dad and his brothers were of that generation that came back to jim crowe after fighting some dying and bleeding for this nation and democracy. German prisoners of war were allowed to eat in restaurants and use the bathrooms where decorated U.S Soldiers and sailors returning home who happened to be Black Brown or Asian they were still denied the basic privileges of citizenship. I know exactly what you mean and they the majority did very little to wipe out racism and anti-Semitism!! Exactly. My grandpa served in the Pacific during WWII and came back to Arkansas just as racist as ever. My mother recalls him being verbally abusive to his black employees when she was present and says it was probably a lot worse when she and her sister were not at the job sites. None of that generation (in my family) was at all concerned about racism they just thought they were naturally superior to black people.My mom's generation started to care and she's light years away from where Grandpa was but I still think of her as racist to an extent.I grew up hearing and repeating racist things in childhood. It took going to school alongside kids of every color and getting called out on my bullshit to change that and I still think I need to be aware of that upbringing and examine my thoughts carefully at times.I think younger people are probably doing better than I was as a kid when it comes to this.We are not too far removed from the way we thought and acted in 1819 because 200 years is not really a lot of time- it's about ten generations of people. Anybody who works with rednecks knows this. Well said!! Liberalism is racism against racists and that's racist.You're all racists folks. Facts. Only a complete fool and idiot would make comments like that in the open showing just how stupid dumb and semi racistthey are. Go troll someone elses site fool!!!

shallah,"""Stop Abortion Now""I agree! Let's get rid of abstinence-only education give people low-cost or free contraception and make raising kids affordable! That's the rub. They don't want to talk about the real problem! We really should stop abstinence only programs.And we shouldn't be surprised about this after the viral video of the Virginia legislator. Her statement of saying the abortion can be performed moments prior to birth is on its face very ugly. She responded very poorly to the question ignoring the unliklihood of the event while just delivering a very ugly hypothetical that few would support without proper framing. Also add on to make it easier for young people to be sterilized if they want. Nah. They don't even give a shit about kids. It's just about oppression. If you're not married at 18 and making babies for the next 25 years you might get a job and be able to live an autonomous life and then what would you need men for? I think they are less motivated by oppression and more about wielding an emotionally weighty subject as a prop to make voters look the other way on the rest of the shady shit they’re up to. I wonder what these states all have in common? I can’t quite put my finger on what they share... Republicans hate women. What doesn’t make sense is how you think this shows how republicans possibly hate women. I mean I don’t know if it’s me or just common sense but an abortion is pretty much a doctor helping a mom kill a HUMAN LIFE. I think it’s a good thing for these states to ban abortions. No one is killed in an abortion.The only person involved is a pregnant woman. You are not involved. You don't have shit to say about it.Stop pretending you control women's reproductive choices you don't. Then what is the doctor killing? Can you explain that to me?

Lincoln was a national political figure for what he stood for not for how he looked. Hahahaha. Obama != Progressive. Beto is a white dude copping a Latino nickname on the excuse ""nah it's cool cuz I have Latino friends!""

If it's to start a discussion you don't participate. In 2014 Pennsylvania's Supreme Court sentenced Pittsburg rapper Mayhem Mal to two years in prison for ""terroristic threats"" and ""witness intimidation."" This conviction was based on his lyrics in “Fuck the Police” a song he rapped on as part of the group Ghetto SuperStar Committee. The song which borrows its title from N.W.A.’s “Fuck Tha Police” name checks officers who had arrested Mal whose real name is Jamal Knox for gun and drug possession in 2012 and refers to killing them and other cops. The officers claimed the lyrics made them feel threatened but Knox held that his lyrics weren’t meant to be taken literally and were a vehicle of his rap persona's expression not an indication of real action he intended to take. Now the federal Supreme Court is hearing his appeal case as his lawyers argue that his first amendment rights to free speech have been violated. The situation is kicking up a larger debate about whether rap lyrics can qualify legally as a threat.https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zma8ax/rappers-are-defending-their-right-to-anti-cop-lyrics-in-the-supreme-court?utm_source=vicefbus&fbclid=IwAR39B126FFm7yMHlOLEDYN6TcXF6oaY-ATHpJ5qFsDK2lA10RdnZb-i_exM&utm_source=reddit.com",0,False,t3_b17ffi,6,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/b17ffi/what_are_some_instances_of_republicans_actually/,1,Don't forget that boycotting celebrity for offensive remark yelling off conservative speaker on campus or firing someone for offensive remark or opinion are not actual cases of infringing on freedom of speech. ,What are some instances of Republicans actually infringing on freedom of speech?,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/b17ffi/what_are_some_instances_of_republicans_actually/
snottrock3t,"Think about it  who do you know that even owns a radio? I agree that we could really use a blue collar and country folks radio presence that could put things in such a way as to get through on a more personal or even localized level. At one time during the 70s there were several ""southern rock"" bands that appealed to younger country type folks who just weren't as uptight as their parents. So we know it can be done. Because you are right at the moment it's largely a vacuum. We need another All In The Family too.",0,False,t3_b12ve4,2,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/b12ve4/lets_talk_liberal_talkers/,4,"  
If you're not a follower of liberal talk radio you may not realize that the field of talkers has diminished quite a bit. I'm not an expert so I may be out of the loop with different markets and not be fully aware of all talkers but I've been listening to a couple of the nationally syndicated talkers for 10 years and some change.

At this point it's a small field on terrestrial radio: **Stephanie Miller** and **Thom Hartmann**. Most recently **Norman Goldman** ceased operation in mid-February. He used to be on in the evenings EST. **Bill Press** appears to only run on WCPT in Chicago. But it's a different game on other formats.

I'm not an expert in radio nor do I work in the business but I've always been a radio-phile myself and since this is a format that seems to be struggling and dwindling (much like other radio formats) I'm curious to know if it's a national trend or just some markets.

I'm thinking listening *age* and *style* are two major factors;  


**Age**

Since most talk radio is on AM...talk radio skews to an older demographic so if a 20-35 year old was going to listen they're not likely to go to AM radio because ""my dad and grand-dad listened to **that**"". They'd prefer to stream it or go the podcast route.

&amp;#x200B;

**Style**

I just don't hear the delivery of liberal talk to be the same as conservative talk. Where I live the local talkers go with a simple format: ""Liberals bad. Liberals trying to destroy us. They're at it at again!"" And if there's any headlines that liberals or conservatives could find a way to agree on (natural disasters Westboro Baptist thugs major tragedies) they spin it so they can continue to push the ""liberals bad"" narrative. Hate to say it but it **sells**.   


And maybe that's why conservative talk is such a big winner...it's a *safe sell*. Plus look at how few independent radio stations there are out there (By that I mean less than a handful of stations owned by one company or an individual) compared to how many are owned by entities like iHeart and Cumulus etc. It's amazing but there are markets that have clearly done well with liberal talkers and have been flipped to something else despite that fact. A couple of years back iHeart owned a station in LA that was Stephanie Miller's flagship station and they dropped her show for Limbaugh. Two years later his ratings were still lower than hers prior to her show leaving. 

Again I'm not in the radio biz so I don't understand how it all works...but radio is in such a struggle it seems. We've had a handful of stations flip several times since the mid-2000's. That was unheard of in the years before. Not that stations would flip but flip at that rate. Crazy.  


Anyway I'm curious to know if there are other regular listeners out there and for those of you who aren't listeners why? Again trying to get the convo going.

nationalistsareRINOs,I’m a huge Beto fan. Even if he doesn’t get top of the ticket VP Beto is an excellent way to motivate younger voters.  I’m excited he’s joining the primary party. I think he was progressive for Texas. Not really for the rest of us. Not a bad candidate I really like Beto but I fear that too many popular democratic candidates running will split the vote too much. It's a good thing it'll get more people to vote in the primary for their preferred candidate and then in the general for the nominee. I feel that the mistake that happened in 2016 won't happen this time around since we know the consequences! I feel that the mistake that happened in 2016 won't happen this time around since we know the consequences!What's funny about this is that people disagree on what that mistake was so it very well could happen again. But how else will the DNC prevent a plurality thus forcing a second ballot and having Superdelegates appoint the nominee at a brokered convention?

Bobsind,"Faux ’news’ - Fox reporting is just there to steer people to the less factual commentary by their personalities. They also give little attention to stories that hurt them elevate stories that frighten or anger the audience about their political scapegoats and frequently give reporting time to stories they know are false in order to plant them with the audience before eventually retracting them days later.trump Lies - https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=opinion-c-col-right-region&region=opinion-c-col-right-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-right-region&_r=0The president averaged nearly 5.9 false or misleading claims a day in his first year in office. He hit nearly 16.5 a day in his second year. So far in 2019 he’s averaging nearly 22 claims a day. (Washington Monthly) Any idea how these numbers compare to past presidents? Not doubting his horrific awfulness but politicians are professional liars so am curious how much worse he is. Whataboutism (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument which in the United States is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda. What? Look it up yourself if you want to refute what I wrote then provide FACTS citations expert data... otherwise it's just republican BS tactics.Crazy-trump’s conspiracy theories - http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/58-donald-trump-conspiracy-theories-and-counting-definitive-trump-conspiracy-guide I’m not REMOTELY trying to defend the ass-monkey. I just think we all should be aware that they all lie a lot. I assume he’s worse like has he ever said anything true?? Just am curious how MUCH worse. In that case you are still using republican tactics by trying to redirect the discussion.If you are curious you should become an INFORMED citizen by providing your own research. Sheesh.

I recommend Politifact. https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/ https://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/ Ty so much for this. 70% of dump’s statements are at least mostly false (or worse) compared to 24% of Barack’s. It so dumb when people call out whataboutism to shut down a conversation. Trump is doing very similar things as past presidents he's just way less polite and sucks at lying about it. Asking how much past presidents lied is a reasonable question that can lead to some good reflection on past administrations and what we let them get away with e.g. war crimes sexual assault.The origins of the term is from the newspapers during The Troubles in Ireland not the soviets. The ""whatabouism"" that soviets usually used was calling out lynching and civil right abuses in America you know terrible shit that we deserve to be called out for. Maybe self reflection and talking about both issues is the best thing rather than claiming whataboutism and stopping the conversation.This is a good podcast about the topic if you want know more. https://citationsneeded.libsyn.com/episode-66-whataboutism-the-medias-favorite-rhetorical-shield-against-criticism-of-us-policyTLDR: you can talk about more than one bad thing at a time it's not too hard Amazing that you would spend all that time condemning me instead of posting a citation FACTS or even an expert opinion...I stick with what I wrote.

Well you see his own golf course is super-challenging the most challenging golf course in the world actually all the great golfers say so and so he never bothers playing at any others because he's so good and they wouldn't present any kind of challenge etc etc Sad. “Golf.com reports Trump won the right to put the champion’s plaque on his locker at the Trump International Golf Club in Florida after wagering a nine-hole challenge to actual winner Ted Virtue who took him up on his offer and ultimately lost.”If you actually read the article he challenged the actual winner for the title as he wasn’t able to participate in the tournament and won. Not nearly the same thing as just awarding himself the championship. He's awarded himself championships 20 times at his own clubs with no official scores recorded and never won a single thing anywhere else. non_participation_trophy how do the clowns who surround him put up with hes nonsense do they just have no integrity They have a paycheck.

ChewyYoda16,"The bigger news is only 76% of democrats supported it. Wtf 1/4 of democrats are apparently insane. I question the validity of this survey for both numbers Yup me too Democracy stops functioning when near half of the voting-populous refuses to accept anything less than radicalism. Democracy stops functioning when tribalism supersedes ethics morality and law. This may be new to the US but it's not new to the human condition. It's not new to society. Though it's absolutely not the marker of a healthy functioning democracy. It's the marker of the end of our democracy.We either restore democracy in 2020 or it's time to move to Canada. #2020||CanadaAnd even if we do restore democracy in 2020 trumpism doesn't go away the GOP won't start to show ethical or moral foundations. They will continue to drive the US to collapse as that is their goal to restore the Confederacy. It's time for us to wake up and see that Fox News and the GOP have that one goal and will never stop driving towards it. This. Even if/when government control changes hands or swings in the other direction: there are still going to be people that support Trump walking amongst us. We still have to deal with them on a daily basis.This is the result of chasing the middle. With Democrats trying to appease the middle it forced the right to go farther right so as to try to differentiate between the Rs and Ds.NOW is the time to swing as hard as possible to the left. Their way hasn’t worked; the animosity towards Trump McConnell etc has never been greater. We need to pounce and take the opportunity to make some real changes that this country sorely needs. I am left as I define it and I agree with the pandering to the middle. I also think the thing that hit the left so hard is the fact that 'liberals' (as opposed to progressives) seem to want to skip steps and enact legislation that is improper. This is to say they want to create some way where people accept others via the law. This is ludicrous. We have freedom of speech. The only change that can happen through our constitution is increased education opportunity and health amongst all of the poor in our country. That way they have the ability to grow acceptance through the generations. Laws don't create social change opportunity does. You need laws that create opportunity and you have to hope for increased social justice as a result. People don't do what they're told quite the opposite honestly. People can argue with me all they want about the words we should and shouldn't use (I agree whole-heartedly) it still doesn't mean that this sort of argument has any weight with a human who hasn't had the opportunity to be properly developed. Yeah fuck those guys.   :) :/ The title of this is a bit misleading.  The survey actually asked if mueller probe “finds” that Trump colluded or obstructed not proves.I’m kind of right leaning and Ill say that if there is definitive proof that he did these things I would support impeachment. But I will say that I think this investigation is quite partisan and seems to be more about making headlines that make the left pissed rather than striving for justice. I mean seriously why has Uranium 1 not been looked into by the DOJ?While I’m here what do you dems think about Trump whole support of regime change in Venezuela? Considering Russia and Putin are very pro-Maudoro doesn’t this throw a wrench into the Russian-agent theory? I don’t support that war I’m just askingI’m not trying to be obnoxious or troll these are sincere questions and I’m looking for sincere feedback. I have an open mind that’s why I’m here. Let's not forget their brains are being ratfucked by Fox and Rush.  If you've not tuned into either for a bit go have a brief visit.  They frame it as though Reagan himself were being unfairly attacked.This is literally the elephant in the room. Yeah thing about Reagan is his entire Presidency is a fairy tale. Truth is he ran on abolishing the fairly newly created Dept of Education overturning a bunch of ""big govt"" programs patriotism reducing the deficit and debt and all the other typical Small Government Conservative nonsense then turned around and expanded government to undreamed of size and exploding both the debt and deficit to historic proportions. But worse than that he negotiated with terrorists before he was even elected agreeing to sell them weapons if they would hold American hostages until after he was elected and sworn in so as to make Carter look weak and ineffective. Then to fulfill his promises to terrorists he sold crack cocaine in every major American city targeting the poor black Americans to fund his terrorist arming program. Oh and he and his crazy wife used a fucking astrologist to devine the intentions of the cosmos to make decisions of the state. Oh I know.  I was alive during that motherfucker's presidency. Reagan was a B movie actor playing a role. Period. The so called Great Communicator could read his lines about mom apple pie and the American way with a tear in the corner of his eye that made the rubes go wild but he was just playing a role. Lowering taxes and interest rates actually made sense in 1980 and it was the one good thing he did but the GOP has turned this into a religion - a one size fits all cure for everything that just doesn’t work anymore. Even Reagan himself raised taxes after he saw what was happening to the deficit. He’d be run out of the party as a RINO now but instead the GOP turned him into a diety and they worship their fevered dreams of what they believed he was - not what he really was. I’m betting the same will be true for Trump 30 years from now. We should start a Reagan Meme campaign targeting Conservatives to follow his policies to the T. I just happen to have a sheet of paper in my notebook that I keep for enlightening Reagan worshippers.During his time in office Reagan:Tripled the national debtDrastically increased regulationsDecreased overall taxes by 0.7% (19% of GDP in 1980 18.3% in 1989)Increased Social Security taxesRaised taxes on businesses investments and gasolineDoubled foreign aid spendingAdded 250k government bureaucrat jobsDoubled size of Dept of Education after running on abolishing itConcerned with Carter's 1.4% rate of government growth Reagan increased it to 3% during his termsIncreased government spending relative to GDP from Carter's 27.9% to 28.7% I posted this in r/the_donald and surprisingly got quite a few upvotes along with the usual conservative dicks and some calling me brainwashed They're very hostile 18 percent of what? How many people were surveyed?How reliable are surveys?How many Trump Supporters are there in relation to the amount of people surveyed? It's linked in the second sentence of the article...At least open it.To answer your question~1500 people polled(533-Dem 560-Ind 399-Rep)~1300 were registered voters80% of self-identifying republican voters said they want  Trump to run for reelection.Both registered Dem and Rep voters had almost identical numbers for ""who's to blame"" for Congress ""achieving less than usual"" whether they felt the economy was getting better/worse and if they felt they are better off financially now than a year ago.What is particularly interesting to me is that the people identifying as Independents were split almost evenly into 1/3s when asked to answer ""yes"" ""no"" or ""not sure"" to a handful of questions on whether they thought Trump or members of his staff asked for or accepted help from Russia prior to his inauguration or if they committed any illegal acts pertaining to the election...indicating to me that there is a large number of people out there that are truly undecided on the matter and ignoring the rhetoric from either side. You have to be super careful believing these polls. A great many of them predicted a landslide Clinton win after all. More accurately they predicted Trump had an extremely small (single digit) chance of winning. And as we all know anything less than ~30% likely is universally impossible under any and all circumstances because apparently that's how probabilities work. Clinton won by 3 million votes. The popular vote polls were very accurate. The problem was too few people (and Clinton herself) looked at the small margins in Pennsylvania Wisconsin and Michigan and campaigned better. There was only a 70000 difference in the 3 states combined.Another factor was that it seems a lot of 2016 Trump voters probably lied to pollsters in October 2016. There was a reluctance for many to admit you wanted to vote for him particularly after the pussy grabbing tape came out. The difference was enough in those three states to tip the Electoral College. And don't discount the FBI announcement of reopening the Hillary email investigation just days before the election because they were blackmailed by the GOP. Dont discount this very lengthy and pretty inconclusive Muller investigation into Trump.

There was this video of a kid that was so traumatized by it at when he was reunited he kept telling his mom she didnt love him or that wouldnt have happened. Asolutelt heart breaking. Apparently thousands of the children held in those camps were sexually harassed by either other children or the “caretakers”.absolutely despicable Lying Bitch like her trashy animal boss Do you think anybody cares what you think? Yeah they use cages for animals and put children in them instead. Republicans are the scum of the universe. It doesn’t matter what they’re called. You could call it a portable containment unit if you wanted. Call it a cage call it a cell call it a room whatever. What it is is an inhumane inadequate living space that contains kids that have been separated from their families. It doesn’t matter if it’s a cage or a room at a five star hotel. Family separation is wrong period. Not all steel fencing that has one entrance that locks is a cage.  Some of these are storage lockers.

This is the job of Congress—oversight.In their minds Congress’ job is solely to block any Democratic initiatives.

Whether it be morals or character or free trade or tax policy or state's rights or foreign policy - you name it. Go down the list of things the GOP has claimed with an oh-so-superior attitude as being the foundation for ""principled conservatism"" they've tossed right under the bus for Trump.

It's the Trump party now and they stand for absolutely nothing but the exercise of naked power corruption and the utter devotion to make the rich richer at everyone else's expense. The same thing was said from opposite parties during the Clinton impeachment. I don’t think the lie is that big. Normal politics Of course the difference being that Clinton got a blowjob - he didn’t betray his country and sell out to Russia but yeah other than that it’s the same 🙄 Well...he LIED TO THOSE INVESTIGATING about getting a blowjob.  There is a significant difference there. Give me a fucking break. Trump has lied about the same thing and even went so far as to pay off at least two porn stars that we know about breaking much more serious laws. All the same people who bloviated every chance they got about morals and character and the principle of the law are now doing everything possible to give Trump a pass for the same thing PLUS selling out our country to the Russians.

Everyone involved with that has been thoroughly outed as a hypocrite. You seem to have me confused wit someone who is a Trump supporter.  I am not not in any way.  I absolutely think that impeachment proceedings would be a reasonable move to make (although I'm not sure if it's wise from a strategic standpoint).The reality however is that Clinton was impeached for his lie not for his blowjob.  That has nothing at all to do with Trump. Bullshit. Clinton was impeached by an out of control GOP who abused impeachment powers for partisan gain all while huffing and puffing about principles they they've later been shown not to have.

It’s very tribal and they just suck in the propaganda without seeming to have real values.,0,False,t3_ayhhlz,4,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/ayhhlz/how_really_much_are_republicans_right_wing_im_a/,3,"Here in Czech Republic in our parliament we have 8 major parties with 281 seats. I want you to introduce you to the one that's the furthest right because it's still considerably too much left wing for Republicans. The party is called SPD or ""Strana Přímé Demokracie"" or in english The Party of Direct Democracy"".

Its program mirrors some parts Republican program. It is very much against accepting illegal immigrants and Islam against giving welfare to lazy moochers affirmative action still increasing taxes for the rich and loosening bureaucracy to support businessmen as well as starting businessmen they want liberation from international organization (in this case EU) strict law and order are sceptic about gay rights and are against taking gun rights (Although in Czechia gun rights are already very controlled and in order to own one you need to get a license like for a car). Sounds familiar?

With such program they're considered as basically far right extremist party even though you Americas must be used to it. Now here are some points which significantly differ them from republicans:

They favor actual fiscal responsibility and balanced budget want to influence government programs such as education and Healthcare and IMPROVE it by better funding (unlike Republicans whose only answer to faulty government program is to defund it make it private and turn it into shit) support useful college fields raise wages to teachers as well as doctors and policemen. They support welfare programs for those who actually need it better conditions and improvement of rights for workers make corrupt politicians and rich people responsible for their misdeeds they don't reason their views on religious zealousy so they aren't ""pro-life"" (as far as I know. Although if they are against abortions they at least support welfare handouts for those who need including (and especially) young parents) don't support abstinence-only sex education and creationism in schools and I doubt that their opposition to gay rights is based on faith they're against property being obtained illegally (which would be penalized with 100% tax) which is unlike Republicans who don't care how you obtain anything and they want to reform political system as a direct democracy hence the name.

Not that I really trust them because probably each of our parties are against corruption yet Czechia is one of the most corrupt countries in Europe so they're probably not any different. But I wanted to share interesting fact.

Proud3GnAthst,"The republican spin is - school choice is good for parents private enterprise does things better than government can.The motivation is - you can't profit off government schools so let's siphon off the funds into something we can grift.  Our buddies can set up ""online high schools"" taught by people who don't have a degree and dumb people can send their kids there while we get a cut of the state's education budget to run it.And - bonus - we can teach them that evolution is fake and jesus rode a dinosaur to save you from birth control. Their actions indicate that they consider it unimportant..... Sounds like you have it about right.Funding is almost always less in red states and scores are usually lower in red states.There are a few exceptions but often in those exceptions they are the red states that pay the most for education out of the red states.For example midwestern red states usually pay more for education....and score better than southern red states that on average pay less.Texas a ""southern-ish"" red state pays more for education than many other southern states and does better.Capitalists should underatand that quality isnt free. The last sentence brings tears in my eyes. Yup and that's why really this must be intentional.They are well aware of the market and what prices do. They certainly want their own kids to go to good schools but by and large could care less if anyone else’s gets a substandard or inadequate education. This is especially true for kids that aren’t white and don’t live in tree lined suburbs. Generally speaking republicans don’t give two shits about anyone or anything unless it affects them. They don’t give a shit about public education because they know wealthy people will always find good private schools. So public schools that are funded based on tax revenue and scores are systematically oppressed until the point where the schools get shut down and the only option is charted schools. That way the people that run chartered schools will profit off what used to be a free right for all children in this country.

GeorgeSorosToe,"You haven't defected you have escaped. Welcome Wait. What's the difference? I get your enthusiasm being new to this.... but no one is taking the fight against T_D. There is no point. Everyone there that’s an actual human is pretty far gone from reality at this point the rest are just Russian bots repeating the daily talking points. Basically... it’s a lost cause but they are protected by special status by Reddit so we just downvote and move on.What you Can do to make a real impact is to contact your local Democratic Party headquarters.  Find out who your local reps are and if any elections are coming up. Consider volunteering or donating to local members who reflect your views. This will have far more impact than trying to rage at the beast that is t_d. Yes you cannot fight narcissists just ignore them and cut them off from your life because all they will bring is pain and torment. Yes you cannot fight narcissistsIsn't OP's story an example of the exact opposite? Respectfully No.t_d is narcissistic and trump himself is a severe narcissist. OP cut off the narcs from his life when he realized they were narcs and therefore only capable of harm and making life worse for him and others. Trump is a monster and should be treated that way. Trying to fight t_d is like trying to argue with an angry racist kitchen table. They won’t change. Narcs are incapable of it. Wasn't OP a member of t_d (etc.) himself? The change in OP was a personal change he met someone that had a deep emotional attachment to that made him see the fallacies in his logic. If we were to go and meet t_d people in person and give them a physical human representation and argument against their beliefs we could have an effect but as anonymous internet people on a screen the emotion empathy and interpersonal connection needed to drive someone out of the fog and take our evidence as honest and not conspiracy is non existent and so that much harder or that much more impossible. He had a slow revelation and came to it naturally. The only outside influence was his wife and it took 5 years. I think he means you can't force it but hope over time they get there on their own. Yes but his decency eventually overrode the need to feel superior all the time.He was in the cave fed stories and lies by the narcs who orchestrated the shadows. When he escaped the cave and saw the real world and he left the narcs behind. Almost all the people who vote for trump are not narcissists they just decided they wanted one for a boss and don’t question his firehose of bullshit and lies. OP questioned it then realized the true pathetic hateful nature of t_d because of it.Being under the influence of a narc is almost never being a narc yourself. When you break from it and stop being the narc fuel the only way is to cut it off like a tumor. And how do you tell who are the ""true narcs"" and who are just under their influence without trying like OP's wife did? They actually have compassion empathy and human feelings. Narcs are monsters. It’s easiest just to think of them that way. Well said! Learning compassion is a long but rewarding road. I'm gay and latin so I should have understood first hand how hard it is to be hated blindly by others... Yet it still took me a long time (and a lot of effort) to unlearn racism homophobia Islamophobia and transphobia. It took me even longer to get rid of religion and spiritual beliefs. Good luck as you continue to expand your mind and heart. Welcome. We’re glad to have you over here on the liberal side. While I can’t promise each and every one of us are as accepting as we ought to be we do give it a good go ~ we’re a long way from the hell from whence you escaped me thinks. I hope you enjoy your new political home on Reddit. Kudos OP. I escaped a very conservative ethos too. It feels so good to be free to show compassion for those that on the surface appear to be different but upon inspection really aren't eh? Cheers and congrats. Coming from Conservitism to balance and now here I wish you the best of luck. What pulled me from the right was a lot of study and historical research defining terminology and constantly information mining to figure out what works and what doesn't.I hope you'll be able to use the lessons learned from your past so we all can have a better future together.Welcome and good luck. can you write your main factor? what do conservatives lack and whats the worst case scenario for it and in what period of time ? What really pushed me a way was the total stonewalling of science in conservatism as a whole then the us vs them mentality all the time. Conservatives are always on the offensive about how bad liberals are and anything good happening in the world is conservative but everything bad is liberal.The worst case scenario I keep seeing in conservatism is the rise of authoritarians and worshiping something. They target the government as if liberals worship it like they do when their people are in power and often don't see how it's possible to not worship a god of some kind. With conservatism you quickly see loyalty and favoritism over qualified people and valuing punishment and reactions to crisis rather than rehabilitation and problem prevention.I wish there was a better blanket term for the kind of individual brainwashed into a religious obedient regiment of thinking and tribalism but it's a consistent chain of traits we see with people around the world regardless of what religion they practice or economic standing. At all times education documentation accountability record keeping journalism the right to know empowering the public are attacked and destroyed. Leaving behind tribes of people who are isolated impoverished and easily tricked that the problems they have are because of those people. Because if there's one thing people will absolutely shed blood for it's feeding and caring for their own and conservatism breeds the thinking to beat that drum through blind conviction. i dont really see it that way i see mostly a different rhetoric with a different value system.i disagree about openmindedness and permeability. but again everything is muddied now and the conservative side keeps growing and taking in classic liberals.im one who transitioned in the different direction. as i understood priorities are essential not idealism. fix A first then go for B if A > B.basically read your context and pick the side that gets results now. when that stops and context changes switch to whatever works Calloused indifference (like what is demonstrated in t_d) requires no courage strength or utility.Well put. That is mode of operation for the rightwing. Welcome friend!Your story reminds me of Platos allegory of the cave. We are glad you have come out of the cave and are seeing the world not the fox news shadows lit by candlelight meant to keep you ignorant and compliant. The world is a difficult place but not full of the fear and hate they spread. I used to be a Christian conservative raised in a very conservative household. It took my mother spitting screaming like a child crying and physically pulling and shoving me one night all because I said I didn’t want to vote for trump to make me realize that there was something really really wrong. Unfortunately I know too many people who are like her as well. It’s like some kind of mental illness or personality disorder. Shit was fucked up. sounds like you didnt get why you were there in the first place and just based your judgement on hers first positively and second negatively .. Congrats! It’s tough to undergo that kind of mental change. Glad to hear you did it because you see the need to treat people with more dignity and respect versus doing it purely for political convenience or something. How we treat the people around us is a reflection of our souls.",0,False,t3_axsxkk,94,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/axsxkk/ive_finally_defected_from_rt_d/,315,"So I’ll preface this by letting everyone know that over the last 5 years I have been undergoing a radical shift in my world views and political stances. Just for reference I am now 24 years of age. 

I was born and raised in a southern rural community by a Jewish mother (now Christian) and a w.a.s.p father. Needless to say my upbringing was very conservative. I had a pretty easy life never really knew hardship or money problems. Fox News on constantly in the house military grandfather lots of closeted racism...you get the picture.

From 18-22 I voted republican in generals and primaries. I thought I was doing the right thing. At 22 I met my (now) wife. She is a black woman. Not usually an important detail in general but due to my upbringing and the town I’m from it’s out of the ordinary and I definitely expected backlash. Some came but none from my family thankfully. They love her and have changed a lot of their ways of thinking. 

Anyway she and I are both relatively intelligent people up and up on our current events politics etc. but we had completely opposite views. A lot of the issues I never took notice of such as inequality racism systemic oppression wage gaps inequity what have you i had never given much thought to and or considered relevant or significant. Her story of her upbringing in public housing and her struggles as a person of color in our area of the nation really struck me. She is on the deans list at her university a solid professional woman. I was always under the assumption that those sort of complaints came from deadbeats etc. I was so wrong. I know that.

Anyway after a couple of years of being exposed to new schools of political thought I began to challenge the conservative narrative whenever I could. I began to be a supporter of universal healthcare lgbtq rights end of the war on drugs ending modern imperialism combating climate change free college etc. When I would see hateful posts on r/t_d that I used to love and agree with I would become sickened with the human capacity to hate and denigrate another. I started voicing my opinions. Much to the chagrin of all active users there. I was threatened doxed insulted. It blew my mind. These were the same people that not too long ago were kind to me. 

Idk where I’m going here. I’m rambling. I just wanted to come here and say that I’m here now. I understand my errors. I know what’s right. I have a wonderful woman to thank for that. Her patience and faith in the good in me have prevailed. I’m not an incel beta cuck for desiring a decent existence for my fellow man like the people on r/t_d would have me believe. It requires a great deal of strength to shoulder truly caring about everyone you meet. Caring that they make enough money to survive that they’re properly educated that they have upward mobility.. Calloused Indifference (like the kind exhibited on r/t_d) requires no courage strength or utility. 

I’ve defected and I’m so damned happy I made it out clean on the other side. They hate those of us who would work to do good for each other. I’ve seen who these people are first hand. I was one of them. We have to match their strength and aggression. We can’t get by on peace and love any more. We have to take the fight to them.

progress18,Trump will set a bad precedent if he vetoes this. Has trump had to veto anything yet? Maybe he’ll just sign it by accident. No. His first veto is expected to be this where he's declaring his refusal to follow the constitution. Just trick him and not tell him what he's signing. Or tell him it's part of the paperwork to get the ball rolling on the whole national emergency thing. Don't get me wrong I'm glad to see any fight against this bullshit.But if congress passes a bill and the President vetoes it what is there to bring to the courts? I'm not sure what will be in each state's brief but probably will give weight to the argument that even congress doesn't think this is an emergency and he's just doing it to go around the legislative branch because he didn't get what he wanted. These theatrics are getting old. The framers didn't think so and neither will originalist justices like Gorsch. I hope you're right Gorsuch has nothing to gain from DJ Trump. He already got his seat and realistically can't be removed. He just cares about making sure fetuses are alive and well until the day they are born. He owes Trump (and McConnell and by extension the larger GOP) for giving him the Supreme Court seat that should have been occupied by Merrick Garland. I believe Gorsuch if it came to it would vote to overturn any case that resulted in Trump being forced out or prosecuted.Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are both in place to protect Trump and to further the GOP agenda.

Only became a big time investor as of late.It was a mistake. This is a terrible economy to invest in.Without decent world trade going on things are only going to get worse. It’s a GREAT economy to invest in. It’s a terrible economy to sell in. Keep buying index funds as the price goes down. Don’t sell. If you sell because you’re panicking you’re a dumbass and deserve to lose your shirt. Index funds are safe investments. Don’t dick around with single stocks. You are unlikely to match the overall market growth doing that. Ride the wave weeeeeeeeeee! I'll follow your advice.I can't promise I will invest in too many stocks at one time I am far too broke for something like that. However I have occasionally seen some promising upticks from time to time. Don’t buy stocks. Buy index funds.

cheweychewchew,Says the man who has never held a dead or dying child in his arms.... What is the death toll of the measles in the U.S. over the past decade. It must be in the hundreds? https://www.cdc.gov/measles/downloads/measlesdataandstatsslideset.pdfNot many Wow it looks like 7 people have died from measles in the United States in the past decade.Why would promote forced vaccinations run by government programs for a disease that has claimed 7 lives in ten years? In my opinion the only reason for the deaths to be so low is BECAUSE of vaccinations. Prior to the last what 10 years vaccines were pretty much standard. Although anti-vax people have like tripled they are still like 1% of the population or something like that. I saw something yesterday but I can't remember the exact numbers.I think this has come from peoples fears that an increasing unvaccinated population would cause measles to spread much faster. I think the push for this is more so to stop the issue before it becomes an issue. Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world. They have made so many advances as far as diseases that a growing anti-vax population could really screw that up. How about having kids crippled with polio again? I hear that's a lot of fun.The 80% drop in measles deaths from 2000 to 2017 (worldwide) is completely attributed to the vaccination. The problem is other countries don't vaccinate as thoroughly and can travel the world no knowing they are contagious.https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measlesI am torn on this topic because I think anti-vax people are completely detached from reality and putting their children at risk and the rest of the population in general. But I don't really agree with forced inoculation. But I have common sense and would get my children vaccinated but I don't have kids so take that with a grain of salt. We can both agree that vaccinations are a great thing and should be promoted at every level.I hope we can also agree that tying down citizens and forcefully injecting them is not acceptable. BECAUSE EVERYONE FROM THAT GENERATION WAS VACCINATED YOU MORON. You're right we are seeing a significant uptick number of measles deaths.From 2000 to 2009 there were 6 measles deaths.From 2010-2018 there were 7 measles deaths.Holy shit! We need to start strapping people down and forcing those vaccinations.Seriously though. I am surprised there is not a larger increase in measles deaths in the U.S. Globalization has increased significantly since the 20th century and people from foreign countries are the ones staring all of these outbreaks. Perhaps we need to institute a quarantine period for anyone traveling to the country from a nation with significantly low vaccination levels. Promoting the benefits of vaccinations has done absolute wonders in the United States there is no need to force vaccinations. Try reading some real data - https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html So you are disputing the CDC statistics I utilized by referencing an article by the CDC that only goes up to 2000. Really? The link was last updated February 5 2018. The point of the article is to point out that measles was DECLARED eradicated in the year 2000 within the US.If that would WORLDWIDE then perhaps anti-vax folks might have a point that measles vaccines aren't necessary but of course the fact that measles can be epidemic in other countries negates that opinion. From your own statement the problem isn't the vaccination rate in the United States but the disease being brought in from foreign nations (data verifies this). If that is the case then shouldn't the solution counter the problem...which is foreign travelers bringing in a disease that was once eradicated. With the boom in globalization we are seeing more and more cases of a disease that was eradicated and almost every single outbreak is attributed to travelers.I propose a quarantine of travelers that are from or have traveled through a nation with low vaccination rates and/or high infection rates. I have no idea... 7...the answer is 7 in the past decade in the U.S. Do antivaxxers reject the polio vaccine too? My god that's scary. You really do NOT want to mess around with polio. When my son was little I was not happy about vaccines because they were preserved with thimerosal which is mercury. Ha so was contact lens solution! But I did it anyway. Now they don't do that anymore do they? So is the objection that a tiny number of kids die from the vaccines? Agreed. Just because I think it’s stupid. I don’t think forcing vaccinations sticks to our values What an idiot.,0,False,t3_axr88g,24,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/axr88g/paul_says_forced_vaccinations_is_giving_up_on/,4,,Paul says forced vaccinations is 'giving up on liberty for a false sense of security',4,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/432739-sen-paul-says-forcing-parents-to-vaccinate-their-children-is-giving-up-on

Biden added: ""It's long past time we get back up that we stand up that we reclaim what every American thought was their birthright: the American Dream.""https://www.c-span.org/video/?302318-1/florida-democratic-party-convention&start=1224Check the transcript it is all there that we reclaim what every American thought was their birthright: the American Dream.Every. American. Not just Whites. Not just Blacks. Not just Hispanics or Asians. Every. American. Please read further into that and see what you want to see. Biden was stating that every American born has a dream of being something or being someone. Trump on the other hand as has been shown by his and his base's foolery over and over again is just talking about Whites. Not ok.Edit: That's the difference between the left and the right. The Left wants everyone included everyone to have a chance at being something or someone with their life wants them to live healthy etc. The Right on the other hand as shown by the lack of empathy for others who aren't rich and white want nothing but supposed ""white heritage"" to be existent and to send everyone back to their ""shit hole countries"" where they never came from in the first place because the people being referred to were born here in the United States of America. So take your crap elsewhere and quit trying to make people who aren't racist out to be such. its fucked up regardless of who says it It's fucked up to equate patriotism with killing 6 million jews. Not if you listen to Hitler's speeches that said the same things. Because its a thing people say in speeches. It's basically conservative virtue signaling. Going straight for a Hitler analogy is way overdone. You and your other cultists are overdone. I think trump is human garbage but there is an unspoken rule in debating first person to use a hitler analogy loses. It’s just too easy. Compare trump with Hitler? http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/adolf-hitler-donald-trump-mein-kampf-bluffed-way-to-power-nazi-leader-germany-fuhrer-us-president-a7568506.htmlNeo-nazi's trying to rewrite history https://medium.com/the-method/white-supremacists-are-creating-alternate-history-486903c747a3 He grabs that flag like he grabs Ivanka. Not if what you're specifically proud of is that your local ancestors signed up to betray the country. You know exactly who Trump is pandering to and it ain't union descendants. Because it's a dog whistle for white supremacists Trump doesn't have a dog whistle he's got a fog horn. RHEEEEEEEE WOOOOOOO There is literally no such thing as white heritage. What makes up the ""white"" American population is a diaspora of Italian Irish English Scottish french German Dutch. Etc etc. All have separate ""heritages"" and cultures even in the context and era of immigration. Whiteness American or not is not a heritage. First I'd say if that were true it would only prove that trump means nothing when he says ""preserving our heritage"". If our hertiage is about preserving that diversity it would fly in the face of his actual policies and words.It's plain that he's referring to ""white heritage"" which doesn't exist.In regards to ""black"" heritage you'd be wrong. The black American population is referred to as ""African American"" because a common culture was formed when the slave trade brought men and women from multiple African ethnic groups to America.  They formed a common heritage at that point and most don't identify or even know their actual ethnic or cultural heritage are. Sure we do. I think what people dislike about trump’s statement is that he only cares about the American heritage that’s appealing to his interests. American heritage is deeper than Trump’s simple understanding.",0,False,t3_awu3kb,73,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/awu3kb/donald_trumps_talk_of_preserving_our_heritage_is/,750,,"Donald Trump's talk of ""preserving our heritage"" is ""sick"" and reminiscent of Hitler says former Obama official",750,https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-talk-preserving-our-heritage-sick-and-reminiscent-hitler-says-1349955

texlorax,"There's going to be a metric ton of dark money flowing into her campaign and not just from the Koch's.Her isolationist foreign policies are extremely popular with a certain hostile foreign power who would like nothing better than we cede global influence to them and that just so happens to be the same hostile foreign power that has recently shown no hesitation in attacking our elections.Expect her to be very well funded and expect her to ruthlessly attack other Democratic candidates both moderate and progressive in ways that validate the worst things that Trump is saying about them. I almost wonder if her campaign is the only reason Bernie is running. Bernie said he wouldn’t run against Warren but now he’s out here. Hopefully he gets Tulsi to drop out she’s like Jill Stein a total fraud. Why do you say she’s like Jill Stein? What connection does she have to Russia? She’s like Jill Stein in that she doesn’t deserve any respect from “the left”. Has Tulsi done anything besides #1 Endorse Bernie early #2 Tweet the missile emergency was a false alarm to give her a national platform?She’s a reactionary not a progressive. Forget Tulsi. And I swear I recently saw a comment by a conservative (Russian troll?) in that AnythingGoesNews subreddit saying Tulsi is the ""best candidate"" the Left has.  I had never heard of her yet this guy was acting like she's who we should follow.  It was a little odd and suddenly might make sense why. Yeah she’s a nobody. Her dad was well known and locally involved in politics and that is how she was able to get into Congress. She’s got really old fashioned ideas about society and is connected to groups against marriage equality and has problems with religious freedom. Gabbard has been talked up by pro-Sanders bots for four years now.  They were pushing her as a possible VP candidate last time.  Using her name will likely get you an ""anti-war"" response from trolls on Reddit or Twitter. You really should look at her voting record before you ask these questions. Yes she has been involved in much more from climate change needs to Medicare for all. Her being anti war seems to be the only thing that is being looked at. Isn't being anti war  a good thing?  I recall it was the right choice to not vote for Iraq. Now it seems the dems are more about intervention that ever. Frightening. Seriously? Because there's a picture of Jill Stein dining with Putin... I'd wager she's in Russia's pocket. Sources? Why do I need a source to say these are the only things anyone knows about her?She hasn’t done anything. I know that she's a veteran and understands that struggle. She was an officer and understands national security. She's not some wacky lunatic who is selling crystals and having dinner with Putin. I'm not trolling I genuinely want to know if Tulsi is compromised similarly to Stein.EDITTulsi explains her positions She just had dinner with Assad. She’s supports of Assad and celebrated Russia helping him.  Her father’s an anti-Muslim Hindu nationalist (while also somehow being a conservative Catholic) and is where she derives support in her constituency.  She’s historically been against LBGT equality (including conversion therapy) of any kind and aligns herself with those organizations.The list goes on.  To say she’s a controversial and complicated figure is an understatement. No. Just no. Stop slandering her.Yes she grew up in an anti-gay anti-Muslim home. Then she went to war and saw her childhood was bullshit. She will have to answer a lot of questions about her past and rightfully so but we can better than the Alt-Right and not slander people I’d love to hear your perspective on her but what did I say that wasn’t factually accurate?  I’m willing to give anyone a second chance but some of these issues are very recent. Oh no I didn’t mean it like that at all. I just don’t think she’s socially liberal enough or nationally known to be a good candidate for 2020.You’re right she served and I respect that. I don’t think she’s compromised by Russians and I didn’t mean to imply that. It does seem like Internet trolls push her as part of the “Bernie got cheated never Hillary!” meme but I don’t think Tulsi has any personal coordination to those divisive tactics. Jill Stein even played nice with anti-vaxxers even though she is a fucking doctor (internal medicine) because so many of those people have zero faith in either major candidate. She refused to state unequivocally that vaccines don't cause autism and that the vaccine schedule is sound medicine.Imagine if an economist ran for president and said that the jury is out on ANCAP and maybe it could be more beneficial for the taxpayer. You might justifiably ask if they had been smoking crack Russia pushed Jill hard in order to draw votes away from Hillary.  Beyond that she spent all of her time and resources in the three states that she had no chance of reaching the 5 percent mark that would mean matching funds.  Instead she devoted everything to what would benefit Trump the most.  She is a frequent contributor to Russian state media and is well paid for it.  And she has been photographed at a Russian  state dinner sitting next to Putin. Stein is terrible and yes probably Russia’s useful idiot. My question was how Gabbard is compromised. Bernie says a lot of things. Are you stating you are for the 800 bases we have in over 70 countries?  Anti war is not isolationist. Killing people in their home countries that never attacked us is something we might not want to do. Just saying. It could make people not like  us and cause more problems.

Republicans had a chance to overturn ACA and chose not to you know? Actually they complained they could be doing something useful for the american people instead. Why don’t they get these benevolent thoughts when no one is watching? Nobody cares what traitors think. Fuck the GOP ! Diplomats died at Benghazi. Wait... Diamond and Silk were at a congressional hearing giving testimony? BENGHAZI WAS A COVER UP In their defense americans died in a violent attack. Trump hasn't killed anyone in a violent attack. 1 - Are you suggesting that Clinton/Obama PERSONALLY killed the diplomats at the Benghazi consulate? How about ""No one has died in a violent attack on Trump's watch."" That's how someone with half a brain in their head would phrase it. Now someone with a FULL brain in their head would instead say ""No one has died in a violent attack on Trump's watch and he certainly didn't try to pretend that the whole thing never happened for two weeks and he CERTAINLY didn't spend a month smearing one of the fallen soldier's grieving widow on social media and Fox News.""Oh and. . .2 - The families of Sgt. 1st Class Jeremiah Johnson Staff Sgt.

We're all on the same side here. Nope. I'm saying that an investigation into the death of Americans warrants an investigation. The article claims that the Benghazi investigation was unnecessary. Anytime Americans die in a conflict like that there should be an investigation. As far as Obama I think he didn't kill anyone. Clinton? I just think she didn't care.They're military not diplomats. If that's the case we can personally blame Obama for all the American soldiers that died in the war that he continued. Don't know why you got downvoted. You're right. Say what you will about the president but you cannot say he's a murderer. Donald Trump: slightly better than a terrorist murderer.Vote GOP. Best slogan ever.

progress18,"I hope so. No strike three. I'm a little baffled at this string of Republican power players acting so rashly in the face of such a sensitive situation. Are they really that desperate the head off public opinion in the face of a potential impeachment that they're willing to self-destruct to prevent a successful verdict against Trump?The hell is going on here? They’re used to getting away with it. And they can look for inspiration to other Republican power players going back to Nixon who did get away with it. Coincidentally Roger Stone was part of the Watergate scandal. The Nixon library said Stone had nothing to do with Nixon. They were having none of it. Why shouldn't they expect to get away with it?  Nixon got a pardon Scooter Libby had his sentence commuted and was later pardoned Elliot Abrams got a pardon and has served/ is serving in 2 Republican administrations since. And that's just the folks who were actually convicted not the ones who infuriatingly never faced charges at all!I'm cautiously optimistic that this bunch won't get off easy but i can see how they might expect to never face any real consequences. Yea! Ollie North is now the head of the NRA and was a ""trusted"" news correspondent for a while. He got off Scott free arming Islamic Terrorists and trafficing drugs! The problem with this line of reasoning is that people who accept a pardon essentially admit to guilt. They lose their ability to plead the 5th on any future court subpeonas. They become a liability to Trump. So there is no way Trump will EVER give a pardon to any of these guys. They're sacrificing their own liberty for someone whose not going to think twice about leaving them in prison to rot. I’m fairly confident whichever Democrat beats Trump will pardon him for the sake of “National Unity”.  Democrats are a bunch of pussies./Source - I’m a Democrat. Yes and they think they can get away with it.Stop assuming they deserve the benefit of the doubt.   They're well past the presumption of innocence as well.   They are guilty face it their actions repeatedly show it.   They're doing anything they can to obstruct justice and get away with criminality.   Is there a smoking gun for Russia collision?   Maybe maybe not but there are crimes they are hiding.    That's the only possibility at this point.   They keep acting as if they are guilty because......... I'm more confused by them willing to throw themselves under the bus for Trump. They can't ""Really"" think that they'd be given pardons for this do they? Pardoned criminals are a huge liability. There is a difference between being OJ guilty and legally guilty.  It’s frustrating but tomorrow Reddit will be pissed about some guy who was wrongly convicted.  The longer this goes the more we learn the less the “deep state” narrative works.   At this point Trump is cooked... unless the democrats dig up some old hippie so offensive to moderates that Trump can beat him...  like someone even Hillary could beat... The only person Trump could beat in 2020 will be Hillary You’re totally right. A 77 year old Bernie who aims to do well for everybody is much more of a liability than an overweight Mr. Fuck Everybody Donny T who doesn’t believe in exercise. Nobody said he was worse but is he really the best guy you’ve got... like in the whole country? donald (purposely lower-case) is also in his 70s and shows obvious signs of dementia.

Proud3GnAthst,"I think Trump has been good for America in an indirect way.He has shown what the extremes of corruption self interest racism divisiveness and political cronyism can lead to. Whats more his ineptitude means that it is becoming highly visible what he is up to and what the consequences are.As a result America is getting angry new ideas and people to support them are emerging from a previously apathetic public. One could argue that without Trump we wouldn't have AOC Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren would still be considered too extreme to be taken seriously. Concepts such as progressive taxation universal health coverage and climate-protecting new energy sources would not even be on the agenda. It even looks like the undemocratic electoral college is in question along with voter selection and gerrymandering.Sometimes things have to get worse before they can get better. Im so happy that AOC is cutting the ""democrats"" into pieces. Pass me a beer. Unfortunately he is also desensitizing the masses to these absurdities and ushering in a new level of boldness in the fundies and conmen that make up the majority of the GOP.

Dems would be negligent (putting it mildly) if they didn’t talk about this every opportunity that they can. It at least should keep the GOP from beating that drum.

Because he's a Republican in a Republican state and to charge him would be to admit once again it's almost always Republicans who commit election fraud. How in God’s name are democrats not beating republicans over the head with this. It’s insane. The party that screams fake votes actually fake votes and you don’t even call them out on it.Edit: btw fuck you Harris I hope every day for the rest of your life there are people shouting outside your house LOCK HIM UP. You pathetic fake religious coward criminal. Fuck you. Piece of fucking shit Glaringly unusual for Dems to not clobber Republicans with this. This has all the elements of a stinging scandal. They lie about others doing what they in fact really do and get caught! I am starting to think the democratic leadership is too damn old and tire easy. They’re just not playing the game. Fine act all high and mighty and proud but when the Repubs are acting like complete shitbags throw it in their face that they are actually in fact shitbags. Wtf is this it’s insane. This should be so easy Spot on. They wont scoop so low. Problem is in this high impact political mosh pit we have these days it makes them look like limp dicks. Exactly it’s like a man up scenario not high ground scenario anymore. Dems prove you’re fucking right quit this fucking pussyfooted bullshit stand the fuck up man. Republicans are making clowns of American society and they are doing nothing. The world is literally laughing at us for voting this degenerate mental defective idiot into office and republicans don’t seem to mind. Democrats FIX IT and never ever let Republicans live down that they voted for this criminal treasonous moron. Trump IS the republican party now.Edit: the best part is these old racist fucks die off and we are left with a progressive America that rejects these morons. 10 more years. I’ll be 40 but 10 more years. Seriously  die off you fucking cunts Yeah I don’t see any redeeming qualities in Republican politicians and that is near impossible. In fact I don’t believe we can be the great country we can be while these goons are around. They poison they cheat they lie they betray they deceive and deny any popular request for life betterments Americans really want. I swear that is their prime directive. Deny everything. Like they are afraid that if the public gets anything it yearns for the whole country goes to shit. That is why they have to go. Nothing good will come while they are still around. Edit: 10 years you say. I hope it doesn’t that long. I hate to think what damage they can inflict in 10 years. What they have done is dived under the guise of religious integrity and taken the least educated poorest most backwards racist white people and used them as a voting base (pretty effective...for now) all while supporting their rich donors while their own constituents don’t realize they are ROBBING THEM BLIND. It’s all religion. These clowns will vote for any republican as long as one meme says a democrat is a satanist. They are quite literally the lowest common denominator of human society...the American Republican Give them a chance.It was only just announced as I was posting it. Mark Harris the Republican nominee in a North Carolina congressional race that was tainted by ballot fraud announced Tuesday that he will not run in the new election for the seat.Harris said in a statement that he has decided not to seek the 9th District seat due to health problems.“Given my health situation the need to regain full strength and the timing of this surgery the last week of March I have decided not to file in the new election for Congressional District 9” Harris said.Harris has been recovering from a serious infection that had led to sepsis and two strokes.He threw his support behind Union County Commissioner Stony Rushing whose record Harris said has “proven him to stand firm on so many of the issues that concern us including the issue of life our national security and religious freedom.”North Carolina election officials last week ordered a new contest in the 9th District ending a dramatic months-long investigation focused on irregularities with mail-in ballots.The board voted unanimously to throw out the November results between Harris and Democrat Dan McCready.Harris an evangelical minister from Charlotte had led by 905 votes in unofficial returns. He was under scrutiny for hiring a political operative Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr. who allegedly assembled a crew of election workers to illegally collect fill out and forge mail-in ballots in two rural counties.McCready began a new campaign for the seat last Friday.Another Republican former North Carolina governor Pat McCrory ruled out running for the seat on Monday.After hinting on Twitter over the weekend that he might enter the race McCrory said on his radio show that he would look at running again for governor or for a U.S. Senate seat in 2022 instead.“My fire in the belly is teaching [please lord no...] and being a radio host and keeping the option open of running for governor or senator” he said on WBT Radio. Fake voter fraud versus real election fraud brought to you by the GOP. Good riddance. Why quit?   Republicans got your back if you are a Republican who commits crimes or steals elections.

progress18,"CO would make it the 12th state (+DC) to join the NPVIC. contact your state legislators to join and make every vote count Isn’t that the Gaymer guy too? Jeez I need to get to Colorado it sounds awesome! White People Wakanda As a Colorado resident I whole heartedly agree. This needs to happen in every state. That’s stupid. It’s been that way for hundreds of years. It'll be ok.  The electoral college was intended to prevent a demagogue from rising to power under the influence of a foreign power and to grant additional influence to slave-holding states.Since it's ineffectual concerning the former and irrelevant concerning the latter it's simply an additional layer of obfuscation on top of the democratic process.  We'll be better off without it. The net effect being that voters in smaller states have up to three times more political influence per person compared to voters in larger states.  It's an institution that inherently promotes inequality. Yes if you believe that one person should have one vote. Which is kind of the cornerstone of a functioning modern democracy.Maybe instead of whining about California and New York states like Tennessee and Alabama can fucking reform their laws build strong educational systems build high quality infrastructure and municipalities attract talented workers through appeals to quality of life and diverse communities and drown out the shitheads who make them look like awful places to most of the developed world but are only a fraction (but a loud one.)Nah. Let’s whine more and complain about Mexicans. That’ll show them. You’re run by Mormons and the laws are designed to benefit them at the cost of the general population.  You’re I. The wrong state pal to hold up as an example for anything but a theocracy Utah is not the only state I have lived in and it was not the only example I gave. Iowa and South Dokota are all good examples you can pick from if you consider Utah to not count. (I do recommend coming to visit though it may not be as it seems.) Iowa sells Soy to China and South Dakota exports oil and the coasts take their cut by middle manning the states that produced it and then taxing the imports the middle states that need them. If you have a legitimate point against what I am saying then please make it clearly instead of making the assumption based on a stereotype its not related to the point I'm making nor is it accurate. Like I said i currently live in Utah and we have great education programs and tax laws that allow business to survive in what we have here Nevada is also a good example with their unique start with gablinging alcohol and sex work but we are severly hampered by our inaccessibility to international markets of our own accord thus forcing us to have to comply with Californian regulations if we want to buy things from a place like china because China makes things really cheap.Utah has literally two universities of note and one is a religious institution that I wouldn't go to if you paid me (I'm secular Jewish I ain't dealing with Mormon rules.)Nevada has no major research universities and most of its economy is tied up in gambling (gablinging?!) or extractive activities like mining.Compare that to California or Texas which has tech entertainment finance research and all the rest. California has an entire SYSTEM of highly-respected research universities and at least 5 or 6 of the best private universities in the world. You want what we have? Do what CA did in the 20th century and build a massive and well-funded system of universities that encourages research into economic opportunities. And then subsidize (not just tax cuts mind you actually actively pursue an industrial policy) industry and actively court them.Oh and don't be run by a theocracy like Utah or be an economic monoculture like Nevada. Court diversity. You want to know why states like CA and TX and NY and others do? They court a ton of diverse industries and people.Don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining. Your criticism are valid to an extent. However that does not erase my point about coastal regions having better access to world markets. Trade attracts tech companies that want to sell to international markets. People go where the money is when they can so its no wonder that the people who can go to those hubs do. They take with them the resources that would have been able to be used to improve their home region because they can make it go further due to regional access to trade. The reason Nevada and Utah do so well is because they have found ways to make their locality meaningful to local investment such as the copper industry or defence tech industry in Utah or the Gambling industry in Nevada. So far I dont see how my point has been refuted. However that does not erase my point about coastal regions having better access to world markets.Eh. I work in tech for a very significant company that's Fortune 100. VERY little of what we do has anything to do with movement of physical goods. 90% of it is access to talent.To put it another way the US automotive market has TONS of people inland: https://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2011/auto/images/cew_establishments.pngWhy is access to coasts so important then for tech? Put another way US tech companies could theoretically be even LESS tied to a specific region if the conditions were right. Besides Boulder is a major tech job center already so it clearly isn't JUST access to coasts. Bangalore in India is a massive tech center and is nowhere near any coasts. Toronto isn't near any coasts and boasts a large tech economy.People go where the money is when they can so its no wonder that the people who can go to those hubs do. They take with them the resources that would have been able to be used to improve their home region because they can make it go further due to regional access to trade.Yes. This is why you invest heavily in growing industry outside of extractive mining and petroleum and tourism. You invest in universities and decouple your educational system from theocracies.The reason Nevada and Utah do so well is because they have found ways to make their locality meaningful to local investment such as the copper industry or defence tech industry in Utah or the Gambling industry in Nevada.Nevada has one major city and it's entirely tied to one industry. Otherwise Nevada is a middle income state at best. And it's easily hit by recessions when people lose disposable income to spend on frivolity. Utah does fairly well but that's because it has significant reserves of various metals. What happens if commodities prices dip?Again I don't think you get it: California ACTIVELY invested in the University of California ON PURPOSE in the 20th century because it wanted to attract talent. This was in the days when it was a relative economic backwater in the US and the Midwest was the heart of American industry. California strategically pulled in talent through smart investments. You totally ignore that as it stands many states have 3x the voting power than others. Why should the minority voice be the majority idea picking the president?The EC was created to appease slave-owning states back when they had a ton of money and power and because there was no way to count every citizen's vote in a timely manner. We have that ability now and every election should be 1 person 1 vote. Coastal states dictate international trade due to their geography and this attracts buisseness with little regard to policy. This attracts more people and with that more money. Middle america doesnt have that luxury and they do need a larger representation in the federal governemeny because coastal states like California have so much financial and population clout that they can cause sever damage to middle state economies without even thinking twice. It happened when Bill Clinton opened up trade to China and fully killed off the american manufactuing industry. The situation is more nuanced than one man one vote and if the regions are not given equal say then the minority is handed a hellscape by those who have easy access to international trade. It doesnt matter why it was created what matters now is how and why it is still used. Kind of like how the Nazi's discovered how to treat hypothermia yes it was born from a very very bad thing but that is not relevant to how it is used today when the bad thing has been removed. Increasing the population would help with that. What does California have that Utah does not? Utah is amazingly beautiful and should be able to attract lots of people but it doesn't because the politics suck. Don't agree? Go buy a beer once you finally find one go ahead and take a sip and I'll tell you all the ways Utah politics sucks. Vote in better politicians relax some of the more ridiculous regulations and start attracting more residence and you too could see why the EC is bullshit. Exactly!!! The reason the coastal cities and states are often brought up is because they are bastions of culture diversity education and opportunities. Middle America used to thrive in manufacturing but decades ago the world economy took most of that away forcing those who would move into cities for better opportunities.Like you said they need to get off the Fox News propaganda teat and vote in politicians who will bring in big companies and embrace new technologies. What's holding back these states from becoming solar and/or wind energy powerhouses? Why not swap out some crops for industrial hemp with which you can make almost anything out of? Elect someone who will lure Amazon or another big company to build their HQ without any subsidies so that the area starts booming again. Embrace the future instead of blaming everybody else for your situation and lack of even wanting opportunities because your media told you they're the bad guys. That would begin to help the flyover states becomes places people want to live in again especially with cities getting bigger and super crowded. You're right about coastal cities being bastions of culture education and divercity. But I believe that has less to do with policy and more to do with access to trade without having to go through a neighboring city to conduct buisseness. Im Utah we have pretty big wind farms and people buying solar panels for their houses quite often so advancing tech is not relevant to my point. My point is that access to trade breeds big buisseness hubs that middle America just cannot build out of policy alone. The reason middle America had such a strong industrial industry decades ago was because international competition was much slower to pick up on new technologies witch is not a luxury that is available anymore due to the free exchange of information being faster than ever because of communication advancements such as the internet and the market being undercut by subsidiezed industries in places like China. Coastal states were not hit as hard by this change because they are trade hubs that dont need manufacturing to survive. The issue is more complicated than just changing policies to make it more attractive to live in the center states if we want to have an honest conversation about what issues they have we need to bring in geography and economics into the discussion as well. Trade ports and easy access to the international market thats what California has that Utah does not. The problems are more economic than political and it's because of region. As for your comment about alcohol it's not that much different than what Colorado does with marijuana and its pretty easy to get a beer or liqour of your choice. Yes it will be a little bit more expensive but those taxes go directly back into the community. I'll happily raise my can to the money off of my beer going to local schools. If you have some sources on Utah policies that are really hurting its economy then i would love to see them. Ports and international market are definitely an advantage and helps to explain why there manufacturing market is the largest in the country. Still though not having ports of entry shouldn't be something that should stop a state from being a powerhouse granted it's just an opinion on my part.But I'll go ahead and disagree with the alcohol vs. Colorado Marijuana laws. They're not limiting the THC in Colorado Marijuana as far as I know yet Utah absolutely limits the alcohol in the beer and other beverages. Current Utah law sets a limit of 3.2 percent alcohol by weight (4 percent by volume) in beer sold at grocery and convenience stores and at establishments operating under a ""beer only"" type license such as taverns beer bars and some restaurants. And I would agree that a tax like that going to education would be great... if that's what happens. But it isn't is it?... No. The majority of that money goes into Alcoholic Beverage Enforcement and Treatment Restricted Account... nowhere in that link does it mention education. Sorry man.But that's the kind of thing I'm talking about. Those kinds of things are what keep people from wanting to live in a state that otherwise could be very appealing. as far as I know yet Utah absolutely limits the alcohol in the beer and other beverages. Current Utah law sets a limit of 3.2 percent alcohol by weight (4 percent by volume) in beer sold at grocery and convenience stores and at establishments operating under a ""beer only"" type license such as taverns beer bars and some restaurants.<This law is set to be stricken down due to Utah being the only market that sells alcohol at a level that low and we are moving to the national standard.I would agree that a tax like that going to education would be great... if that's what happens. But it isn't is it?... No. The majority of that money goes into Alcoholic Beverage Enforcement and Treatment Restricted Account... nowhere in that link does it mention education. Sorry man.<I stand corrected thank you for the insight. Most people who live here believe it goes to education like the tobacco tax and knowing this gives me modivation to petition to change where the funding is going. I owe you a drink but maybe something a little stronger than what beer is availabl here. Also liquor is not set to the same standards as beer because its sold at state owned liquor stores you can get any proof you want short of rubbing alcohol. As it is Republicans from red states bully Democrats from blue states. Californians get fucked by Utahns. You just want what you don't deserve. Can you give me some examples? I'll give you a big example. As of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that Utah Republicans helped most everyone who's not rich has to work years longer or harder. The country's finances are mostly a zero-sum game so when the rich suddenly get richer most everyone else must get poorer in the long run. Most likely Social Security and Medicare will be gutted to pay for the tax cuts. Many Californians got extra fucked because now they pay higher taxes after the change to SALT (state and local tax) deductions. Can you send me a link to the relivant numbers? Id love to see numbers I am not finding with my own bias.As for Californians getting fucked by those tax cuts how much of that is because of the SALT rahter than the federal Taxes? From where im standing its helped alot of local businesses I visit regualrly.Also could Utah have done that with state laws? Or did they have to get a coalition of states to enact that on a federal level? California heavily affects states like Utah with their own state laws for example there is california's gun control laws prevent many companies from selling firearms and ammo in this state because they set their policy to California's so they can sell there as well. That's one off of the top of my head and I do not believe Utah could do the same thing with a state law that would directly affect California. Utah Republicans helped the TCJA with their votes. No link I'm talking basic logic here. Most everyone could benefit from the TCJA in the short run but not in the long run. You can improve your own personal finances in the short run by borrowing money but when you waste the money you'll be worse off in the long run. When the rich benefit in the long run from the TCJA then everyone else will pay for that. There are only 2 pots of money available to partially pay for it: Social Security and Medicare. They'll almost certainly be gutted.Every state can potentially bully every other state. Solving that problem by adopting minority rule is worse as we've seen with the TCJA. Every state can potentially bully every other state. Solving that problem by adopting minority rule is worse as we've seen with the TCJA.<Was it Utah alone that passed the TCJA? Of was it a coalition of states? And if those states have to band together against California in order to get something they want then what does that say about the power Cali has over these other states? I'm not saying we adopt minority rule I'm saying lets make a fair playing field so that unfair advantages like access to international trade do not go unchecked.As for how you explained the TCJA I may not be understanding correctly but it seems to me like it would only be a problem if the people who received a tax cut are not handling their money well to begin with or are in an area with strict or high SALT. The tax cuts for the average taxpayer won't cover but a small fraction of the future losses like cuts to Social Security. That's a mathematical certainty because it's an almost zero sum game. When the rich get suddenly much richer most everyone else must lose. Many will lose their jobs and savings in the greater recession or depression.You can't have the fair playing field you're talking about. You have only 2 choices: majority rule or minority rule. Whichever happens the ruling group imposes its will in the other group. At least the states have some rights so they're not forced to have the same laws. When you play in a multi-state economy you must play by those states' rules. Why is that so hard to understand? You are absolutly right however there needs to be compromise just like in any buissiness transaction otherwise it turns out to be a bad deal for the state that doesnt have a say in the rules. Look up what happened when Wendover wanted to build a dispensary and how both Utah and Nevada worked on a compromize to get it built so that both states prospered. Infact it helped Utah get a Cannibis bill passed that while still restrictive in possession opens the door to the market anf changes while also allowing wendover to take full advantage of Nevada's canibis laws.California on the other hand can ignore Midwestern states for the most part because there are few if any viable competitors for access to the global trade with the east that these Midwestern states can turn to. Allowing these midwestern states to have a stronger voice in the federal government gives them the ability to have a stronger say in international markets rather than leaving the coastal states to dictate the terms unchallenged. I hear what you're saying the problem being that midwestern states keep voting for representatives who only care about blocking Democrat/left ideas no matter what no matter how much they'd help them instead of representing their people and trying to bring back industries and companies who could reinvigorate the states. It sucks we lost manufacturing decades ago but no matter who did it it would have happened at that time eventually with the growing world economy.We need major election reform and a hard long look at overall representation nationwide. Too many have been ignored for too long. the problem being that midwestern states keep voting for representatives who only care about blocking Democrat/left ideas no matter what no matter how much they'd help them instead of representing their people and trying to bring back industries and companies who could reinvigorate the states<This is true but it is not the main reason why Midwestern states mostly vote Republican. Democrats have not been comming in and helping on the local level in these states while republicans have been granted not as active as they should be. Democrats have not been listening to the perspective of the Midwestern states on the problems they are facing and have not been bringing in buissines like they claimed they would. Republicans have been at least trying to keep existing industries there alive. While I dont agree with this practace and would prefer investment being made into the communities this is something.There also is a difference in needs of the Midwest than the needs of the coasts and alot of midwesterners see coastal democrats pushing for policies over the entire country and they see it as out of touch because republicans are the only ones willing to do anything on a local level for them.They also want more local governance so their vote has more say in what their community is like and less federal because the federal government isnt exactly good at making sure that individual. Local communities are not squashed under broad policy.We need major election reform and a hard long look at overall representation nationwide. Too many have been ignored for too long<I agree there does need to be a conversation about it. I just don't think getting rid of the electoral college is they way to go because Im worried about the growth of the federal government and eventual coastal rule and the political pendulum being thrown out of balance. If you remove the winner take all then each vote counts as one regardless of where it's cast. So no more blue or red states just voters. Problem solved. My problem is based on regions without first hand access to trade getting a fair say not spesifically what party holds what state. I believe the electoral colledge provides that fair say. If you have an alternative I would love to hear it. Hmm maybe we should get some kind of system where states have representatives that are sent to Washington DC to make laws and pass bills. Some kind of house for them too. A representatives house yeah. Nice sarcasm. I would be fine with it if the executive poweres had not been expanded as much as they have within the passed 50 years. If the president did not hold as much power as it does now then I doubt we would be having this conversation. Nah we would because a republican president hasn't won the popular vote since the 1980s. It's beyond time for a change. I think we need to focus on voter fraud jerrymandering and securing the pols first. Both democrats and republicans use these tactics to alter elections and its sickening.I also think that the republican party does need to do more to actually get involved in with the public more as I am tired of their hands off attitude. Giving people the conditions to flourish doesnt really do much unless you invest timemoney and effort into the community.However I do not think getting rid of the electoral college is the way to go unless we have a way to give the middle states a fair say in the presidential elections so the coasts do not rule the country.As for the rhetoric of a republican president has not won the popular vote since the 80's is a dangerous rhetoric. Yes there is a problem with republicans not putting effort into outreach but be careful not to slip into the mindset of one party rule. That shit is dangerous for any community state and/or nation. You need a citation to say democrats do all three. Gerrymandering is a given but voter fraud? Source needed.Okay again if there is no winner take all there are no state by state votes. Just people. So if conservatives are as they claim a majority in the US they would win. If they aren't then they would lose and they would have to deal with it.It's only dangerous if that party suppresses opposition and it could be argued the EC does that since it hands republicans the oval office when they lose the popular vote. The total populations of the top 100 cities added together don't equal 50% of the population and that's assuming every last person in these cities (some of which are conservative leaning) vote with the Democrat. Your fears are false. My point was not about cities or political parties as they are not relevant to what I am talking about it was about geographical trade route advantages and the people who do not benefit from them getting their fair say. Oh so now when numbers refute the logic it's about something else. It's about trade routes right right. As if you actually need to see a candidate live in your old High School's gym to know who you're voting for these days anyway. If you have read the entire discussion thread I have been having with other users you could have a broader context of where im comming from. Trade access attracts larger and denser populations. Im talking about it on a state level because that is where its most relevant. But it's okay to have the main candidates spend 96% of their money and time in the swing states as they did in 2016? The modern EC is a game to be gamed stop pretending it's this bastion of democracy. Well we live in a republic soooo.... Yes we do but that doesn't mean the minority should have the majority voice. Yeah let’s just steam roll the minority opinions instead! Solid plan yo Nobody is saying that at all. Why don't you find it odd or messed up that our current system gives the minority view (which is in the minority because it's less popular and rejected by the majority) the majority power? I personally don’t think it’s fully one way or the other. The two houses of Congress help ensure that IMO. The votes for the EC still have significant sway for states with large populations. I agree that the order of the primaries and caucuses do have greater influence towards the beginning but I think that’s more cultural. The politicians gain momentum and approval from the early states which I think sways votes in later states. I don’t like that the game is to spend more time and money in those early states but I don’t think that will change if you abolish the EC. Politicians will just spend time in huge centers and neglect the middle states or still cater to the order of the primary elections.Idk. I’m not really trying to be contentious with you but rather just stick up for the small states that I’ve lived (and still live) in. You know?I want the best system we could have but I think we’re so diverse that making too many general rules doesn’t work. I’m pretty big into letting states decide how they want their laws and culture to be.What do you think? The Senate was put in place to stop mob rule. That's not and never was the intention of the Electoral College. I am perfectly fine with the MAJORITY of the country getting to choose their president.Tyranny of the minority is worse than tyranny of the majority. Mark my words when we start messing around with the constitution at will not end well.I am pretty sure that is happening now with the minority in power. I believe there is an individual who didn't win the popular vote who is attempting to bypass Congress and divert funds away from other programs in order to fulfill a promise he made to said minority by declaring a fake national emergency that that individual said he doesn't need to do. How is this constitutional? only serve coastal populations.I hate this point people keep bringing up.Did the Gulf Coast go to Clinton? No. Did the Alaskan coast go to Clinton? No.Of the top 10 most populous states only three went to the Democratic nominee in 2016 (California New York Illinois) the other seven went to Trump (Texas Florida Georgia Pennsylvania Michigan Ohio North Carolina).Each of those states have a coast. The next populous states in order are Michigan (R) New Jersey (D) Virginia (D) Washington (D) also with coasts. Arizona (R) is next with no coast then Massachusetts (D) Tennessee (R no coast) Indiana (R).Of these 17 states 11 of them went to Trump 9 of which have coasts. How are we disenfranchising coastal people? Look at the election map by county. Regardless of which way those states went there’s a visible blue pattern.FYI. MI is not a coastal state. Coastal means land and sea not a few big-ass lakes. Look at the election map by county.Just did. Of the states that went to Trump most of the counties touching the coast voted for him.And even then wouldn't the ones that are most effected by climate change and rising waters vote for the party that believes in climate change and wants to combat it? Interesting...Coastline: a line that forms the boundary between the land and the ocean or a lakeRegardless of semantics it doesn't negate the point. The point is that the strongest trends for blue are in the coastal states. It shows where the main democrat populations are.We clearly showed that was not the case. Of the states that I mentioned having a coast the majority went to Trump. What ""pattern"" are you implying?they’re implying only the Atlantic & Pacific not Gulf or Artic.Okay I guess if you remove any point that refutes your claim then you would be right. But every state touching the Gulf went to Trump and half the Atlantic went to Trump.I’d consider it a silver lining if global warming wiped CA off the map.And the benefit of that would be...?Also you ignored the other 7 states that border the Great Lakes.I did mention Pennsylvania Ohio New York Illinois and Indiana. Only ones I left out were Wisconsin (20th in population; went to Trump) and Minnesota (22nd in population; went to Hillary).Even then I was talking about population. People want to remove the electoral college ""because either California or New York would control every election"" which just wouldn't be the case. Why are you against the will of the people? Why is the vote of the people ""mob rule""? Shouldn't the majority voice of the people choose the person who will be president of all people? Because the people are easily bought off. It’s about a few states having to much power. It’s about all the states having an equal say. The office of the President has grown to powerful and needs to be constrained by the other branches of government. The Electoral College allows the voices of smaller states to be heard other wise they will be muffled or made Irrelevant by higher population states. The President is only there to run the day to day operations. Congress is responsible for dictating policy and spending but they have abdicated that responsibility over the last 40 years to the president essentially alleviating themselves from any responsibility. If you don’t like the president it shouldn’t matter because you have a representative and a voice in the houses of Congress. Im not against the will of the people I am against the will of the government and so should you. It’s about a few states having to much power.The swing states agree. In 2016 both candidates spent 96% of all their time and campaign money in the swing states. That's not right. And imagine if they only had to go to the most populous states. Rule by minority instead right? wah wah Maybe the same could be said to you? You're the only one complaining here fam Mob rule is not a good thing. Unfettered Democracy is not a good thing. There is a reason it was put in place. The fuck does this comment even mean Not OP nor do I agree with the sentiment but...If the popular choice of 49 states went to candidate A and The popular choice in CO went to candidate B with this law CO’s cotes would still go to candidate A against the will of the citizens of CO. States have the right to award electors in any way they want they have full authority to decide how they’re given.Founding fathers wanted us to choose electors not presidential candidates. Massachusetts quashed that. Then it’s the fault of Pennsylvania and Maryland they’re all awarded to the candidate with majority.The electoral college you have now is nowhere near what it originally was. I’m not saying it’s the original and that it can’t be improved. I’m saying that without it small states loose any voice they had. A system based on 1 person 1 vote means every person's vote counts evenly. That's as fair as it gets. In a small system yes that would be fair. But we’re not on a small system anymore. We have two giant political parties that control the society. Therefore it is more important for the states to have a greater power on issues like the president. We the people control society by whom we vote into office. Your voice is 3x that of many others as it stands now why is that fair or in any way democratic? Because we’re not a democracy we’re a republic (I’m not talking about political parties). Our voice influences those who make the decisions. Our elections are democratic. How many Republican voters in California don't get a say in how California's electoral votes go?  If we scrapped the EC or at least made it proportional to votes a lot more conservative voters would turn out to vote in solid blue states making it more competitive.  And of course vice versa in solid red states. Womp womp The Senate fulfills that purpose. Having the president chosen by the minority repeatedly is a recipe for disaster as we're seeing now. No the Senate fulfills the purpose of giving states an equal opportunity to pass legislation. (Yet even this idea is being challenged). Electing a president is a different matter. States should have equal ability to choose the president.This might came as a shock to you but there are a lot of the population who supports our president. (Not necessarily supporting EVERYTHING he does). The president has helped the economy in rural areas the former president help destroy.Edit. Before you comment on the legislation comment I do know that legislation is part of the responsibilities of the president. But if you have two branches of congress that are under the full influence of the uneducated majority this who spell even more trouble for the county. But the president isn't helping rural areas he's hurting them. All the non-rich must work years longer or harder as of 2017. Social Security and Medicare must be gutted to pay for the tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations.The majority are taking a legal constitutional path to effectively eliminating the electoral college. It doesn't matter to me that 40% support the president. Those people hurt me so I work against them. States should have equal ability to choose the presidentNo people should have equal ability to choose the president.BTW how has Trump helped the economy in rural areas? I'm generally curious because his trade war has harmed farmers so much (I have farming cousins in Missouri) it took a bail out to try to repair the damage. To put it simply (because I really don’t want to get too into it) he’s helped the oil and gas succeed. That’s what a majority of Wyoming’s economy is based off us. Trump has given a greater demand of local oil and that alone has lifted several struggling areas. I'm generally curious how did he give greater demand of local oil? Don't bother arguing with people who advocate for governing by the minority they have little to no logic or rationale. Their perspective instantly crumbles when they become part of the majority being ignored",0,False,t3_auu61z,166,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/auu61z/colorado_governor_will_sign_bill_aimed_at/,542,,Colorado governor will sign bill aimed at bypassing Electoral College,542,https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/431425-colorado-governor-will-sign-bill-aimed-at-bypassing-electoral-college

What is determined by the level of respect is the legitimacy and authority of power.  And what people are willing to sacrifice to uphold rights determines whether they deserve them. But the state and state run media has redefined what is ""legal"" for the populace.It's tried to redefine quite a lot including words like ""election"" and ""President.""  We'll have to fix that.Power does equal Authority in the minds of Americans.I'm American.  Power is not authority.What do you do when most Americans won't even admit anything is wrong?Most Americans definitely recognize things have gone wrong.They still think the Government is on their side and abides by the Constitution.On the contrary people are being less-than-discerning about seeing the Republican Party as a statement about American governance when the two things are effectively antonyms.Donald Trump was put in power by Russia specifically to destroy both American institutions and faith in their capacity to ever function.The solution is simple and must be applied vigorously: Stop pretending the Trump regime is the US government.  It's a foreign insurgency. It's a foreign insurgency.Oh brother. you think Republicans are the problem.That Republicans are the problem is indisputable.Does that mean you think Democrats are on your side?We're on the same side.  I agree with the Democratic Party on the issues all of the Presidents I admire are (or would be today) Democrats and virtually all political progress made in this country in the past 80 years has come from Democratic leadership.What's your basis for attacking the only party that can honestly claim it's done anything of value for this country in generations?

""Both sides"" this or that nonsense when moral differences are stark only serves the side that is clearly malevolent. regularly scheduled MSM.Don't forget to to accuse me of shilling for the ""deep state.""Isn't it interesting that it's only in discussions with Democratic-leaning voters where this nonsense propaganda is pushed trying to convince people Democrats are equivalent to the raving Nazi lunatics of the GOP?  For some reason (I wonder why) that narrative is never pushed in conversations among Republican-leaning voters.Almost like the purpose is to discourage demoralize and distract liberal voters. We never had rights only what the powerful rich were willing to cede. We're not free because faded ink on paper says we are. Quite right but laws are not ink on paper.  They're not tangible.The words merely reflect the decision not encompass it. The threat of you killing your would-be slaver is what keeps you free nothing more. Freedom doesn't require the concession of its enemies.  It's a unilateral decision. From a constitutional law perspective the ability to do this was constitutional and still is. The case that decided this-Korematsu- has never been expressly overturned by the court  Although several justices have mentioned it being the worst case up there with Plessy and Dred Scott. So seemingly it would be prevented by the court but as it stands it is good law. From a constitutional law perspective the ability to do this was constitutional and still is.In a free society constitutions are a social contract written in vernacular language and published without censorship for a reason: Courts cannot rule that up is down and make that the law.  They simply undermine their own authority by doing so and that's what Korematsu did. Perhaps but that’s very abstract. The way America has operated in regard to interpreting the constitution is the court acts as final say on what the constitution means. The court has ruled for decades that the constitution was a contract between the federal government and the people at the time of founding. This means we were all born into a contract we didn’t sign we just have justices to decide what that contract means in current times. The court ruled that Korematsu was permissible. That means the constitution allowed Korematsu. The court undermined its own reputation but not the constitution. The court is also unique in that article iii gives the court no explicit powers the court has created all its own powers- the president and congress just agree that they have them and follow them. The court would most likely never rule similarly as they did in Korematsu simply because they would undermine their own institution’s legitimacy with the people. The court cannot however undermine their own authority because they have the authority that is granted to them through their own rulings. This essentially means whatever they say is law it’s just if those rulings aren’t widely accepted then people won’t view them as legitimate and congress and the president won’t follow them.Full disclosure I think Korematsu is one of the 5 worst decisions the court has ever handed down. It’s sickening and wrong. I just have studied constitutional law extensively and understand the legal legitimacy of the decision. I am in no way defending the ruling or advocating its outcome. I think this is a good idea since it seems like Republicans like to break the law and probably would try to lock up citizens of Mexican descent Muslims etc. FDR. #3 president all time.",0,False,t3_auku0y,22,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/auku0y/three_asianamerican_lawmakers_introduce_a_bill_to/,440,,Three Asian-American lawmakers introduce a bill to prohibit internment like that of Japanese Americans during World War II,440,https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/politics/japanese-internment-law-trnd/index.html

texlorax,2 of the last 3 Presidents have lost the popular vote.The system is broken. A Democrat has won the popular vote 6 out of 7 times yet the party only got 4 of the 7 terms. The last time a Republican became president by winning the popular vote was 1988. That says it even clearer. So we don’t have a living Republican president that took the office by winning the popular vote. He was already president then re-elected. He initially became president by losing the popular vote. I used some verbal gymnastics to get that statistic I made. The interstate compact approach won't solve it.  The first time a state in the compact votes against the state's voters the majority in that state will lead a referendum to withdraw from the compact. If it were ever enacted it would likely fall apart after one election. You’ll never entirely take their advantage away so long as you keep the amount of electors tied to the amount of congressmen because the senate will always give small states an advantage.  It’s understandable why the senate works the way it does relative to congress as a whole but it makes no sense for it to work that way for the presidential election. That’s all accurate; was just pointing out that it wouldn’t entirely kill the small states’ advantage even if it would diminish it. There really isn't any logical reason why the US President isn't elected with a straight up popular vote.Hell make the ballot a ranked ballot and your results will be even more democratically viable. Easier said than done. The small states don't want to give up their power. To abolish the electoral college we would need a 2/3 senate vote 2/3 house vote and adoption by 3/4 the states.Near impossible Or a number of states that carry 270 electoral votes to join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. So far there are 172 electoral votes involved. The far more viable option. I don’t think at the time the Founding Fathers trusted the masses. I believe it’s the same reason senators were not directly elected. I could see someone disagreeing with that but I don’t think that an electoral college is not logical. It is when it doesn't fulfill it's purpose regardless of what politics Donald Trump is pushing he is clear as water 100% not suited to be president of anything.And the electoral college responsibility is to avoid this.It's not working as an electoral college just as an engine for suppression of votes through gerrymandering and other undemocratic techniques. Regardless of who is exploiting it. This. Freaking genius man. There absolutely is a logical reason for the electoral college. It’s the same reason the legislative branch is divided into the senate and the house of reps. The electoral college allows the States equal representation in the presidential election just like the senate allows States equal representation in the legislative process. I understand that some people have a problem with that but it is logical. The entire balance of power that America’s constitution has created would altered without it. States don’t vote. People do. And if we abolish the EC everyone’s vote will count the same. Unlike now where people’s vote is larger or smaller based on where they live. States do vote. This is a republic not a democracy. A union of states with equal representation. That’s the way the constitution works. But there is not equal representation. Large states have far less power than small states. There is no rationality in that. Punishing states for being populated? How does it make any more sense that Trump should lose after taking the popular vote in 30 states?election resultsLook at the map in the link. Look at the state by state results. If the National popular vote were the only vote that mattered than our entire system of government would lose its legitimacy.I agree that it is bazaar when a president wins without the popular vote but you have to look at this from the perspective of someone who doesn’t live in a high population state. Why would they agree to participate in a system where every decision is made for them by California or New York? There were significant numbers of anti-Trump votes within the boundaries of the 30 states he carried. Those votes must count in the final tally. Those votes don’t count in the final tally. It’s a winner takes all system. That is the problem. The point being that if the Popular Vote Movement were to win enough support those votes would count towards the national majority and determine how electoral votes would be cast. Because despite your inexplicable insistence to the contrary states don’t vote.It doesn’t matter if he “took the popular vote in 30 states.” He wasn’t running for president of 30 states he was running for president of all of them.What do you mean “every decision is made by California or New York?” You still have senators.,0,False,t3_au8qc9,95,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/au8qc9/after_stinging_presidential_loss_popular_vote/,581,,After Stinging Presidential Loss Popular Vote Movement Gains Momentum In States,581,https://www.npr.org/2019/02/24/696827778/after-stinging-presidential-loss-popular-vote-movement-gains-momentum-in-states?ft=normal&amp;f=139482413

I don't have a single comprehensive source that would be great for someone new to the subject but I think looking at the relationship between greenhouse gases and global climate in the past will be an informative way for you to look at our current problem. It's also really interesting and I think it will be fun for you.

Flake learned it from the old master John ""Brows furrowed in concern"" McCain. I will believe it when I see the results in election night. One of the best things about ranked choice ballots is divisive candidates don’t get elected in elections using them. Collins is doomed. Good. Let’s see her gone next election Yes yes we have!!!

progress18,Until some swing or red states do this nothing will come of it. Agreed but this is essentially a message and it is unprecedented. A sitting president will not be on a ballot. That’s wild. So you could say their ballot was...😎...unPresidented... I could but I won’t But you should. lol Uhh. THAT‘S wild Just like Lincoln Can't win the electoral college if you're not on the ballot in any blue state. Yes you can. Newsflash - Michigan Wisconsin Pennsylvania those aren't blue anymore.  Again until I see this measure passed in a swing state or a red state I don't see it being meaningful. New Jersey wasn't breaking red anytime soon. Ok terminology then purple states. If even one of those (Michigan Wisconsin or Pennsylvania) passes a law like NJ then Trump won't win. MI just elected a democratic woman governor and legalized recreational cannabis. I'm pretty sure they don't care for Snyder's right wing bullshit. Dems are one seat away from total control in Virginia. That'd do alright. Seems reasonable to expect every other politician to do the same. Yep they added an amendment to the bill so that everyone in the New Jersey legislature would also have to release their returns before being allowed on the ballet. Love right wingers claiming this is unconstitutional with absolutely no understanding how why this is indeed legal. If it's not expressly stated in the Constitution then it's unconstitutional according to some. The constitution enumerates powers for the federal government everything else is reserved to the state government. This is a state government power. Its actually stated in the constitution. according to someI don't think /u/PinkIrrelephant believes that just is pointing out how literally some people think. Usually when it's about a single event that directly benefits/hinders their own political agenda in the moment and their partyline/media feed tells them to think so. I feel like even if we see his returns it’ll just be like everything else in this presidency. Shock and then something more shocking the next day and so on and so on until we die.  I guess I’m wondering how will seeing his returns be any different from any other crazy stuff we’ve seen?  But yes I agree all presidents should have to show all their financial stake holdings. Won't that just result in a whole bunch of write in names having to be counted by handed making new jersey election results take a large amount of time and manpower to conclude? Or he could just release his tax returns. Which do you think is more likely?

One thing I wish Jussie Smollet might have taught people is to wait until the facts are out/investigation finished before deciding on a result... Lol Reddit won’t ever do that Reddit isn't the general population yeah there is a large platform but we can try to build a world that actually believes in waiting for everything to be done before we start throwing accusations.

That won’t be built anytime soon. Twitter has destroyed journalism and turned everything into outrage culture. All journalists on twitter are in a race to the headlines and it has caused everyone  not fact check stories before they run with them.

previouslyhuman,Why are so many concerned about his age? He's only 5 years older than trump one year older than Joe biden and one year younger than Pelosi.  I would love Bernie for president. Bernies pretty old to be running for president? Wouldn't it be better if it were someone a bit younger? The last thing we need is the president getting sick :( He has a lot of energy and his ideas are solid.  I am willing to vote for him again in the primary due to reservations about the other candidates and how much actual power they have. Sanders has enough energy to be a powerful voice and competent and inspirational leader.The other strong candidate is Harris and her strength is why she is under attack from the left and the right. Good point. But he is more likely toget fatally ill due to his old age than your average person. That won't be good for American moral. You could go to one of those sites that calculate how long you might live and type in what we know about his health and age now and it gives you an expected longevity.  I think  his odds are good but then I am from a family that always has a one or two 90-105 aged elders still living in their own homes and not helpless until their last year or months. My grandfather age 95 his mother lived to 102 (father's side) my great grandmother (mother's side) 105. etc. They said the same thing the first go round and he hasn’t slowed down. It’s one of those “talking points” to discredit his campaign. Get ready for months of hearing the news talk about his age and “more realistic” candidates with less public support. John Williams is 86 years old and writing a new Star Wars film score as we speak. Bernie can be President. John Williams has talent and skills. Bernie has neither. Are we lowering ourselves to subjective opinions now as fact? At least he learned from his previous run and didn't wait to the last minute to declare his intentions to run.That said no Bernie stop it.  You're not helping.  You couldn't beat Clinton and you think you can beat actual 'likeable' candidates?All you're going to do is split the party.  Again. Hillary isn’t here for him to use as a contrast board. His ideas are certainly more specific than the rest of the pool but they’re overall the same in the broad points. True but this is going to come down to clean fundraising in the end. And he just quadrupled the competition today. Nobody is as popular as Bernie. Just a fact. It’s pure Bernie. What’s in it for him. He’ll again cause division and possible 4 more years of Trump when the real Dem candidate wins the primary and Bernie Bros are so butt hurt they again decide to screw us. Just offering a perspective for your consideration - What if instead of blaming the ‘Bernie Bros’ that ‘screwed us’ in 2016 one instead flips that and thinks ‘well... we understand enough about human psychology to know that people want to vote for someone exciting and the DNC and their supporters selected a candidate that wasn’t exciting enough to get people out to vote in key areas thus allowing Trump to win. Please remember that even in a two party system there are always three options: candidate A candidate B or neither. And intentionally voting ‘neither’ is a legitimate choice that the DNC needs to account for in their strategizing. As usually this logic fails in the Presidential election when there's two choices - A democratic choice and a republican choice.If you're not voting for a democrat even if your primary candidate loses then it's YOUR FAULT. Because that not voting is a direct vote for the Republican candidate.Period. So Bernie folks that were unhappy and didn't vote for Clinton or voted for some other fraudulent 3rd party candidate are exactly the reason why the US is in it's current dilemma. Hey.... Wait. Not-voting (voting to abstain) is not the same as casting a vote for someone. I can understand you’re feeling strongly but please be reasonable. I think you are discounting (still...?) how unpopular Hillary truly was. Also you state that even if your primary candidate loses that you should still vote for the selected candidate in the general on principal.  So you think Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz supporters should’ve voted for Trump regardless or should they have taken candidates case to case?  Btw... I’m not a ‘Bernie Bro’ so you can lower your rifle. This is just discussion. He's the most 'likeable' candidate in the race now. Literally a Front-Runner based on polling. Which poll is that? He’s the least likable person according to me. https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/20/bernie-sanders-2020-first-day-fundraising-money-1176072 Rubes will be rubes All of them. https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/bernie-sanders-democratic-frontrunner-president/583066/This is the most recenthttps://www.reddit.com/r/ElectionPolls/ Down with Bernie!

jonfla,I had a Lyft shared ride with someone who seemed like he really cared about football but said he hadn't seen an NFL game since they blackballed Kaep. They really fucked up here. The NFL actually got double screwed. Many viewers stopped watching in support of Kaep many stopped watching in protest of Kaep. They were the swirling mr krabs meme in the middle My wife is the same way.  She stopped watching then.  Most of her family did too. Yup I'm done. On the other hand I know dozens of people who boycotted the NFL when the refused to punish players for kneeling... Afro man no stand for flag song...derp What amazed me is how Trump is contemporaneous of the military and that's ok. I never miss a game. I don't watch but I don't miss it. Wocka wocka! I used to do drugs. I only watched the big games but I won’t be anymore. Republicans who still support a racist president support his racist philosophy sitting idly by while trump appoints racists to government positions and republicans who allow trump to make racist laws tweet racist comments make racist comments at his 'campaign rallies' and during his ‘presidency’ and build CONCENTRATION CAMPS - then people who give that tacit support to trump are racist… In other words people who STILL support trump; are RACIST by default. https://www.alternet.org/right-wing/united-states-witnessing-shocking-rise-alt-right-violence I’ll say it once and I’ll say it again.

cheweychewchew,"Why? Just why? It's pathetic. It seems like is he will visit every Asian country until one of them backs up his Nobel peace claim..Too bad he spends more time trying to get one than doing something to earn it Because Trump wanted to say he'd been nominated then say it wasn't fair when he didn't win and Obama did.Japan probably acceded to the demand because they depend on the US for a lot (their military is constitutionally limited to a small defense force) and they didn't want to risk souring relations with the POTUS who seems to attack all of the US' allies. Manipulation. It's routine for people (including many in the White House) to praise Trump to try and control him. Abe is no doubt well aware of this.You know those stories about frightened people clapping for a dictator so long their hands bleed? Same dynamic. He's like a damaged nuclear reactor and the praise is the water desperately being poured on to try and keep him from melting down. Trumposhima; when a presidency goes China syndrome. In hopefully less than four acts. Trump is clinically mentally ill with several different conditions do not expect logic or reason from him because he is mentally incapable of either one. I guess cuz Obama got one? I don't think they hand em out like participation awards. You actually have to do something to earn them trump (and republicans) - using the Nazi playbook:“Make the lie big make it simple keep saying it and eventually they will believe it.”—Adolf Hitler Donald Trump is racist homophobic and xenophobic; all tell tale signs of a Nazi.

Well that and “Everybody Poops”. It was tremendous. I've always preferred the sequel Sometimes I feel like everything he does is just to get back at Obama for that one time he singled him out for being a birther at the white house press dinner. You’re probably more right than most would think. Trump is just the type of sociopath to take such offense at it that he would go this far to “take him down”. But in 10 years one will be dead or in prison and the other is Obama. Look at his face when he's getting roastedYou can almost see Trump administration policies forming in his head.Two asides here:Holy crap I miss Obama he was actually human.when the right says everyone just decided to hate Trump when he was elected they never consider the fact that he was the king birther and a perpetrator of one of the more vile things the right did during Obama. He represents the worst qualities of that camp. thank you!!! He was mad before that.

The counterargument research and the statistics you provided made me change my mind.  /s“These are radical islamic terrorists and she [Hillary] won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He won't use the term ‘radical Islamic terrorism’” trump said during the Oct. 9 debateHey trump; Can you say Radical Right-Wing Terrorists?Are you a RACIST? Do you support trump's RACISM?Do you want a FASCIST country where minorities are exterminated like what happened in Nazi Germany?Do you advocate a VIOLENT REVOLUTION so you can push around people you don't agree with?Do you think that twisting the truth into constant trump LIES is fair game on reddit?Do you think that your obvious LIES will influence anybody? Especially considering the constant corruption of the trump administration can't be hidden anymore... no matter how much you try to deny it? Dude. Seriously who's paying you? You're entire post history is just pasting the same links repeating the same lines over and over again.I'm a little embarrassed I got baited to be honest “If I were to remain silent I’d be guilty of complicity.”  Albert Einstein“Never be afraid to raise your voice for honesty and truth and compassion against injustice and lying and greed. If people all over the world...would do this it would change the earth.” ― William Faulkner“Get up stand up Stand up for your rights. Get up stand up Don't give up the fight.” ― Bob Marley“It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” (Jiddu Krishnamurti)“Nice people made the best Nazis. My mom grew up next to them. They got along refused to make waves looked the other way when things got ugly and focused on happier things than ‘politics’.  They were lovely people who turned their heads as their neighbors were dragged away.  You know who weren’t nice people? Resisters.” (Naomi Shulman) That is haunting. Thank you. Trumps new bookArt of the National Emergency If Trump grants himself Emergency Powers through the NEA does that give him the authority to end the Mueller Investigation? If so due to the early 80's Supreme Court ruling that limits Congress's powers to override Presidential Emergency Powers there seems to be nothing Congress could do about Trump ending the Mueller Investigation which in the past even Graham and McConnell have indicated that the Senate wouldn't let Trump do. According to abcnews there are currently 31 national emergencies active right now. Mexicans existing is not an actual emergency. I’ll take “No Shit” for one hundred Alex.

How convenient it is that now it can be used as a political power display against democrats.  Get a clue. If that's true then he's an even bigger idiot than I thought and it's obviously not an emergency. You kinda just proved my point about it being a political ploy... According this trumpster (and likely many more) checks and balances = abuse of power.Let that sink in. Look! It’s one of Donnie Moscow’s boyfriends talking about patriotism. This is adorable.

cheweychewchew,I’m stumped as to why this isn’t enough to squash this idea of allocating emergency funds to fund a wall. He said in his emergency declaration “ he didn’t need to”  that’s it. He doesn’t need to it’s not an emergency case closed. No soup for you. No money for a pointless wall. So it was just so he could get his way? What a child. If you didn't need to declare an emergency it's not an emergency. Let's see how that holds up in court. No wonder he lies all the time. The rare occasion he actually tells the truth and it’s likely going to screw his ‘emergency’ in court.Which is a good thing. Americans overwhelmingly voted to elect democrats into the House to put a check on Donald and the GOP by 11 million+ votes. By declaring this “emergency” he is shitting on democracy and the voices of the people. This is the exact type of shit that dictators do. The difference between Obama and this bullshit is that those emergencies were REAL. Not to distract from the Russia investigation distract from the results of his massive tax scam or to desperately fulfill a campaign promise. Fun fact he's apparently taking money away from the god damn Pentagon and national security agencies for this.

I wanna see how much he owes Deutsche Bank. How have they not been leaked yet in two years of this shit?They seem to be treating this unelected fuck's tax returns like national security secrets... Realistically what could we expect to learn from his tax returns that people don’t already know? That the wealthy's tax returns aren't subjected to the same level of scrutiny that the rest of us face when we file?  I think many of us suspect it but when/if they're released and everybody gets to see the amount of blatant money laundry laundering that has occurred without a whisper of oversight from the IRS?Edit. Trump has gutted the IRS That Trump is not a billionaire.  Above all things this is the reason Trump will not release his taxes. We would love to pretend there is a legitimate reason and there are many legitimate reasons in his current position but Trump is too narcissistic to care.  If given the opportunity to prove he is a billionaire he would take it. Oh he's definitely a billionaire now that he's been in office for 2 years. We get to see how much money he owes and to whom he owes.  That way we can see how compromised he is. U.S. Banks don't lend him money it's all foreign. Are there favors being made in government as a result? I'd like to know. We're not talking about a guy like Obama we're talking about a scumbag here. The reason why he's hiding them. How do you know what you know? There is a difference between what someone ‘knows’ and what someone can show.  The tax returns will show that the concerns many people are well founded demonstrate the financial frailty of Trump i.e. not nearly as wealthy as he asserts the tax policies he promoted for the people actually benefit him greatly or that the tax returns are a red herring. That he's not worth anywhere near as much as he'd like us to believe. Where does it end?” [GOP congressman Mike] Kelly asked. “What about the tax returns of the Speaker? Members of Congress? Federal employees? Or for that matter any political donors? There is no end in sight for those whose tax information may be in jeopardy.”I literally cannot see how they are trying to claim this is a bad thing.

progress18,"This must be why the White House sent out their Chief if Staff to talk to all the major media outlets Sunday and Monday. I thought it was weird he kept saying in every interview that it is possible Trump will unilaterally shut down the government again because Republicans might agree to something he doesn't like. Just picked up my car or else there’s no way in hell I would have seen this. Fox News is reporting 1.5 billion in wall funds in the deal. They're probably pretending the fencing funds count as wall funds for their egos Oh it was the headline they had like 3 guest talking about how much of a win it is for Trump. I saw the article mentioned 55 miles of fence but thought they were talking about repair funds. Maybe there’s flexibility in that money They are literally arguing semantics 'bollard fencing' is a wall. Whatever you need to tell yourself to feel better about Trump's failure.... according to the article they are giving him money for the wall.. I mean there are legit things to fund in border security and immigration courts. Frankly Trump’s original request for $5bil had a lot of money devoted to these things and only about $800mil for actual construction (a down payment?). Which is the number Democrats have been offering all along right? Less actually. Less. The original was like $1.7B Trump will shut down the government again take the blame initially and just weather it out... because his supporters don't care and then say it is ""Chuck and Nancy's fault"".We've been through this before. Only difference could be if Congress decides to bypass the president with a majority in support of this bill. There’s a conversation coming about immigration that Republicans aren’t ready to have. It’s going to focus on the other side of the coin. The side that is exploiting the cheap labor of millions of undocumented workers and if you live in America you have benefited from that system. It’s the system that promised jobs for pennies in the dollar to anyone south of the border willing to take those jobs. They came here for decades working in wretched conditions with no rights if they are victimized by their employers or anyone else. They came here anyways and built a life so that their kids can have a chance to be more prosperous than they were. And every time you shovel meat into your mouth at the dinner table or admire the four walls and a roof that you call a home remember that it’s undocumented hands that butchered that meat and pounded nails into those roofs. And now they are the scapegoats because it’s more convenient than the truth. Do you really think that conversation is coming?  I feel like no one wants to bring that up and it'll just be scapegoats all the way down. Retreat to your safe space buttercup its gonna be a really tough year for fanatics like yourself ;) Do you realize that you and your ilk who respond to everything with such a binary perspective prohibits any potential to exchange ideas?“‘The Donald’ is the second coming of Jesus!”... “All you liberals are nitwits!”... “There is no collusion!”Most of us have capitulated in attempting to convey evidence that directly contradicts all of your glorious perceptions. Your comments here are just some of the millions of identical alt-right enunciations declared either without evidence or citing the right wings entertainment network called Fox as being truth.If you’re serious in wanting to understand the real problem with this country it behooves you to realize that extremist views (both right and left) are scuttling the foundation upon which the US government is built.EDIT: added links for reference Lol.  Binary perspective.  Look through the comment chain and see who was open to other ideas and who wasn’t. I’ll give you a hint: it was me and even after attacks I still upvoted.  :D You must not work. Construction manufacturing and anything in between. Anything else? I’m not sure what that means.  Is that what you are saying you do?  If so what type of manufacturing and more importantly are you very busy under Trump.  We have so much work in steel industry we don’t have enough days in the week for all the work.  All kidding aside this current economy is so booming for us in steel it’s insane. I’ll even upvote you for replying. I’m a stainless steel TIG welder/fabrication. It’s a mixed bag. The tariffs bit us pretty good. Cost me my Christmas bonus. We are busy at the moment but it’s cyclical. I have been welding scrap pieces together so we don’t have to order more expensive steel. Well I wish you nothing but the best.  From what I hear underwater welders are where the money is at.  As someone who fears open ocean it wouldn’t be for me but maybe for you. I like to give people a hard time but also am open to discussion when people don’t just shit on me.  Good luck buddy Man I love shitting on people though😂. I had a friend who did underwater welding and he told me that barracuda would just watch him. Just swim up behind him and watch him. I don’t trust that lol. My luck would be one decides to take a chunk out of me and swim off.

Honestly it’s probably way lower Based on Rasmussen poll:http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/trump_administration/prez_track_feb12 First they say 50% which may seem like a small difference but it's pretty significant.Second Rasmussen has a reputation for skewing polls right: ""After the 2010 midterm elections Silver concluded that Rasmussen's polls were the least accurate of the major pollsters in 2010 having an average error of 5.8 points and a pro-Republican bias of 3.9 points according to Silver's model.""538 has him hovering around 40% and they are considered highly reputable (as accurate as polls can be which should always be taken with a grain of salt) It's a daily poll. If you hover your mouse over the graph 52% was yesterday. Otherwise I agree with your other points just wanted to source where people get the 52 figure from. Oh gotchya - my bad! 538's 40% isn't a poll they're an aggregate which is what you should be looking at. RCP has an alternative one.

progress18,JFC that video with the Trump supporters forming a human chain waving flags at the border...sick stupid people. These are the same people who value their guns more than kids lives so I’m definitely not surprised. To be fair guns are used exponentially more to protect people than they are used to commit crimes. Besides if you take guns away it won't change the mentality of people that want to commit crimes. They'll just buy guns illegally or use a different weapon/form of violence. I wouldn't say pro-gunners are child haters or anything like that they just want to protect themselves. Of all the mountains he could choose to die on it has to be this one. This just showcases what a piece of shit he is. He's convinced that this is the one thing his zealots might turn on him over. Trump himself doesn't give a shit about the wall but he's belatedly realising that he's absolutely fucked  and thinks keeping the morons loyal is his only chance. I don’t know that he doesn’t care about the wall. I think he views it as a monument to his “greatness”. He’s just tricked his people into thinking it’s a policy issue. It’s not. It’s a vanity issue for him. He just wants “his”wall.Then he walks off to “You Can’t Always Get What You Want”. The epic cluelessness. Increasingly desperate demagoguery.

loveskoalas,This is not news.  Everybody knew this up front but the motto in politics is if you live by the sword you die by the sword. “Was”? He is still fighting every day for this wall. Don’t make us feel like we’re past it. The point is that the wall idea was thought up because immigration is too complex of an issue.  Offering real solutions would be way too difficult and wordy.  It would be hard for the audience to get down with it and it would be hard for Donald to remember it so they think up the wall because it’s simple easy to remember and it gives a solution that the voters can easily understand. Yup... dumb it down so everybody can understand:Build the wall.How will it be funded?Mexico will pay for it.Easy enough for the most simpleminded folk to understand - and with Trump supporters that seems like most of them. Political? Nah. More like personal. I don't disagree with the article but I think there's more to it.The great wall of china is the (or at least was at one time recently) the only man made object visible from space (or so I've heard...).Trump is extremely jealous of that wall. He wants something like that wall in the US so people in 100s or even (preferably for him) 1000s of years in the future will be thinking of him every time they see 'Trumps Wall'.That's all it is. Petty jealousy. Fuck him. My name is Trumpmandias King of Kings.Look on my works ye mighty and despair! that's pretty far fetched if you ask me So it was a post-it note for Trump's brain. Sounds like the average corrupt politician The wall isn't the issue. It is the military and reserves having to posture at the border as opposed to maintaining moral and readiness.This administration's policies are a danger to the safety of this country.

To say one or the other is better or in more power is nonsensical. If you consider CNN NPR and BBC to be left you don't understand the political spectrum to begin with. None of those is left. CNN and NPR are both completely dependent on corporate money to survive. The BBC is the official voice of the UK government. None of them are controlled by their workers. None of them advocate for workers controlling production.My advice is that you find out about what choices you actually have. They extend far beyond what Republican media falsely calls ""left."" How far gone do you have to be to claim that CNN doesn't have any left-wing affiliation? Ask yourself this question; Does Trump lie acessively? Have fact checkers proven this? Which news organizations have reported this. And which ones don't. But for every dumb Trump lie that gets backed by Fox there is an equally dumb CNN false report. Jussie Smollett Russian collusion claims from buzzfeed/TMZ.  Both sides are pushing an agenda through the bending of truth or through complete lies. They both are. Each and every topic you want to read about you should try and look for direct sources on that topic and form your own opinions. From there you can see back-up commentary on places like.. Reddit! Fox = Corporate sponsored Right Wing bias CNN = Corporate sponsored bias Singular conservative talk shows = Donor generally right wing biasYou should think of news into at least two mindsets: News and Editorial.News = A plane crashed here on this date at this time.Editorial = This tax plan is good because my preferred political party's donors or constituents will benefit.",0,False,t3_aps91e,12,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/aps91e/media_dilemma/,1,"My political identity has changed a lot in the last few years. I used to be strictly conservative (I grew up in evangelical Christianity) but once I left my religion I also started becoming more liberal.

Now one thing I have a hard time thinking through is media bias. I watch CNN NPR and BBC news as well as read some things through PolitiFact. However some of these are considered left-of-center but they touch on issues that I believe are important but have little nagging doubts from my conservative past about.

I also overhear stuff from peers from Fox News and singular conservative talk shows. It's all about the left lying and why Trump is trying his best and a very Christian bias as well.

I just have a hard time wrapping my head around this pretty far-fetched concept of propaganda. Are the left wing sources propaganda that is indoctrination or is it the right wing sources? If they both show different sides (albeit one being less alluring to me) aren't they both indoctrination in different ways?

progress18,"They’ve laid bare their hypocrisy well before Trump.  They have reached peak hypocrisy in Trump but he is the last hurrah of a dying cult. Never underestimate the ability for religious people to amaze us with how hypocritical they can be. Trust me they are no where near their peak. I do agree it is s dying cult. I just wish it would die before it does any more harm. it was enough to maim the Catholic Church SBs are the absolute scum of the earth. Don’t count your chicks before they hatch. This could get worse if this isn’t sorted out properly. ha laid bare makes me think of bears getting laid I overheard a religious woman say loudly to her friend (so everyone could hear) ""At least we have a Man of God in the White House!"". I said ""Oh you mean that con man who screws porn stars and brags about grabbing women right here?""Her and her friend kind of made a face and whisper to each other. The other one said (dismissively) ""I'll pray for you"" as they walked away. I said ""Don't bother."" Assuming this story is true it is quite sad.  I'm Christian and I go to a southern baptist church in Alabama of all places - so I can confirm that this is a prevalent attitude.Just so there is no confusion those women were not practicing Christianity.  They were practicing right-wing politics.  Not somehow both but politics plain and simple.The fact that a large number of mostly baptists have equated religion and public policy makes them no different than muslim jihadists - this is a simple fact.  The issue in politics of course is crafting the narrative to make this distinction from the bulk of Christians.  The minute a politician goes out and says ""the religious right are like muslim terrorists"" Foxnews will turn it into an attack on ALL of Christianity.  There needs to be a wedge that can separate those 2 groups. So you don't think that I am anti-Christian most of the people I love in this world are Christians. My three aunts for example are probably the best people I've ever met. They are true Christians who live Jesus's philosophy of pure love for mankind. I actually don't even know their political beliefs because they don't ever discuss it believing that politics and church don't go together.I also don't think politics and church go together and I appreciate your comment. I'm sure we would get along very well. Good luck to you.

John Piper a reformed pastor (at least in the present day reformed is pretty far right on the theological side) is not a fan of Trump. Matt Walsh a compete right-wing moralist also is not a fan. Though I'm a progressive Christian and I disagree with almost all that John Piper has to say regarding Christian theology (Matt Walsh as well and throw in his boneheaded moralist politics) I do have respect for them that they're consistent in their convictions. A lot of conservative Christians that I know voted for Trump but were pretty reluctant.But yes nowadays most white evangelicals have unequivocal support for Trump even the ones who didn't like him during the 2016 election. I'm not even sure if Piper or Walsh still hold their opinions now that two years have passed. And yes abortion is probably what turned them over to Trump. Abortion is the go-to issue for conservatives who want the Christian vote. The religious right is a horrid god awful cult of disgusting garbage worthless human beings. Every single one of those brainless moronic cowards deserves to be doxxed and exposed. FUCK this backwards 1850’s way of thinking.

Zelk,"Not to oversimplify your point but to add something:We HAD limited gov. The 1800s.Children worked. The poor who got sick died. The banks went bust every 40 years (called a panic).

Workers had no rights or safety and the poor ones often died while working with no support for their families when they did. Swill milk made it so that kids couldn't even drink it.The wealthy usually offered little charity and no concern for the sick and poor.

&amp;#x200B;

It's that simple. It doesn't matter where you go the moment more than one person is working together there is some kind of government at play.   


Today on Ask Trump Supporters a question was posed asking when does the government best the private sector. Incredibly the most common response is the Military. That command economy merit based society with high training welfare hands on management held accountable regulated faction of the United States that commands floating cities with more airpower than most nations in the world and global reach.    


Ask for examples.  
When talking to anyone trying to sell you that the private plutocratic invisible hand mentality is the best way to go ask for examples in real life and history. Because at no time in history did a plutocratic/ corporate society held out for long before the economy stagnated and corruption rotted that system of government to the ground. 

&amp;#x200B;

The best reasons to have an organized governing structure is accountability anti-corruption data tiered data analysis of the people and resources and bulk purchases of goods and services to supply to the public and prepare for disasters and issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Explain basic civics.**   
There are generally two axis to most government types. Power and authority on one wealth and economy on the other. 

&amp;#x200B;

With power and authority three of the most basic examples are easily explained as starting points. A single ruler (Monarch Dictator) a layered rule (Republic leader based) and a rule by the people (Democracy). Each with advantages and disadvantages.  


[https://trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/teacher\_lessons/3branches/1.htm](https://trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/teacher_lessons/3branches/1.htm)

&amp;#x200B;

**A King.**

A single ruler is quick and easy. Fast and effective. However is quicker to corrupt and pursuaid into making bad decisions especially when they believe they are the best of the best because of the seat of power they hold. In the States we have the president who is elected mostly by the general population to fill this role and can act as a dictator in times of emergencies and crisis. Because an imperfect action is often better than no action at all.

&amp;#x200B;

**Representatives**

A layered rule such as a Republic or some kind of body of leaders offers better information and management of specialized tasks and responsibilities. It requires more effort to corrupt and distort as hopefully merit based and elected officials will have a shared say and have to discuss with peers for actions. It also means they are held accountable by their peers if embezzlement or criminal activity is pursued or carried out. In the states we have Congress and the Senet. Elected into office by groups of people to represent them. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Rule by all**

A total democracy is a full rule by the people it's slow and a fools vote is equal to a scholar. Democracy is determined by how accountable the government is to the people and whether or not the government reflect the populations best interest or is corrupt and serving other powers such as a foreign body or corruption. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Wealth &amp; Economy**  
This is where Conservatives will tell you the government fails at most. Spending other people's money is the worst way to go about things and should be avoided at all cost and try to sell you that private business is the best way to go. I have no examples of when privatization was better than an uncorrupted government once funding was factored in. Every project in history performed best when it was given resources proper management and was held accountable. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Economic Anarchy**  
Free Market and the invisible hand. Where the wealth is incentives follow. No regulations or management is taken into account and theft against the poor and powerless via slavery is quick to take effect. Workers can't defend themselves against an organized power with money and marshal forces so they are limited to basic work. Micro empires rise as corporations but in every instance the most organized regulated groups of people take over and the Freemarket disappears. It is the line when the greed get too greedy paranoid and are overthrown. The fall of Capitalism is when consumers are bankrupt and the wealthy blame them for it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Command Economies Socialism &amp; Communism.**

The very moment control is taken to manage resources is when a command economy takes shape. Socialism is where the governing body takes control of some or all services to enable the public to perform well by mass managing bulk buying and problem prevention through trends and analysis goods and services such as roads military disaster response emergency response medical financial safety nets disability management and so on. The last elements to be taken over and the push into Communism occurs when luxury services and economic caps are put in place to regulate the wealthy and prevent them from becoming too powerful to manage and leave ruin the state. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Examples**

We have many examples in history regarding the private sector taking over and the moment a business opens shares to the public workers comp and investments drop. The moment pro-profit healthcare was allowed under Reagan we saw healthcare costs increase. When we look at public and private schools the biggest factor is money. Public schools that are well funded and regulated perform just as well as private schools.   


In the United States we have cities that specialize and perform better due to the focused mindset than if they were attempting to be jack of all trades social centers. Unless you seriously think everyone should design and build their own car from scratch it's a very good idea that we have predictable settings such as roads that are maintained for specialized vehicles to operate on designed by people who specialize in vehicular design. They couldn't design those cars if they were too busy farming and training in a militia. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My final thoughts ranting about this**

The only people who are trying to tell us the government is bad are people who are either ignorant of basic civics economics and history to know better or are lying and trying to sell mass privatization to fleece the population of power and wealth.   


This has been a rant that is my observation and understanding to explain what the fuck a government is because this argument is beyond stupid by now. I hope better people chime in here to correct and refine my attempt here. To create a post that can be easily linked to for educational purposes as to what the hell government is and why its used. Accountability and management.   


If you read this and hate the government I honestly hope you chime in with outstanding examples of how the private sector with the same economic resources outperformed a managed government organization. Because as we have so far Governments landed on the moon[invented the computer](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000984.htm) built roads in Roman times and as we see in the Military are capable of identifying and applying organizational practices that give us the most bang for the buck. The only modern examples I can think of would be the fact that [NASA needs more funding.](https://www.21stcentech.com/money-spent-nasa-not-waste/)

&amp;#x200B;

So when you try to tell me that Government is stupid or some other nonsense I'm going to need you to clarify. Because as far as I'm concerned corruption is the problem and Conservatives don't hate organizations they hate being held accountable and having regulations keep them in check from making money off the suffering of others.  


As usual I'm going to post something I picked up somewhere. Two links that show how Conservatives are the problem in America and I have yet to see anything that counter discusses this.

Crazyfoolgaf,"Wonder what the ACTUAL tax paid was in 2018 vs. 2017. The refund amount doesn’t mean anything if less has been withheld throughout the year. Yeah this was the game that trump played with some. 20 bucks more a paycheck but it all came out of the normal refund. This is what I suspect is happening.   I have not done taxes yet as I am waiting on a form. Soon as I am done I plan on doing a comparison to figure out where/what the 'cut' was.A few other posters have stated these tweets may be misleading.  I am loathe to admit but they have a point.  So soon as I am done will do a 2017 to 2018 comparison. Please do. I am in a situation where I sold a house so I can't make any kind of comparison to last year. I haven't filed my taxes yet but I have prepared my return and I look to be getting almost the same exact refund as what I got last year. Looking at actual taxes paid I did indeed pay less than last year but I'm still supposed to get the same refund.My tax situation is quite simple so I'm not sure if that helps my situation. The reason why I'm getting such a big refund is because my W4 is actually filled out wrong. I figured this out early last year but I didn't update it because of all the changes with TJCA being implemented. I think I need to update it now so I can stop giving the government an interest free loan every year. Considering we can look at the actual changes to the tax law and see that it certainly is the case I'd say that's exactly what's happening. I haven't done my taxes yet but I know that my taxes are lower... This is the real question. I hate bad arguments especially from my own side. People complaining about refunds may look foolish if their actual tax burden went down and they just didn't understand withholding. Almost no one in the middle class had their actual tax burden go down because Trump took away several of the most common deductions. I'm doing my taxes later and have a weird situation that will be hard to compare to last year. A basic calculation we did with he changes in deductions showed we would save about $300 for the year. A pittance. For the most part my understanding is that the people seeing their taxes go up were deducting a lot of state taxes  but that got capped so now they're screwed. That was a big change. It was designed to offset the massive tax cuts being handed out to the richest people in the country by increasing taxes on residents of mostly blue states which tend to have higher state taxes. Yeah ""offset."" True but if you didn’t change anything about your withholding it should be the same right? Unless they changed what the withholding means? If you have a mortgage you can no longer deduct the interest paid on your loan unless you make over $350 K a year.  That's usually one of the larger deductions most people take so expect a smaller return. Great...why does someone making over $350k a year need the ability to deduct interest on a loan more than someone making less than that? So they can trickle the benefits down to me? Apparently that is how Congress now defines ""middle-class"".  Go figure. That’s so fucking ridiculous. My husband and I make 155k combined and live in a small city where the cost of living is very reasonable. We feel like upper middle class. We can save we can generally buy the things we want we can take trips. We live within our means but we live comfortably.There are some places where I’m sure 350k feels like middle class but not the majority of the country. A household income of $150000ish put you in the top 5% area. The difference between top 5% and top 1% is staggering though. This! I fully feel lucky/grateful/comfortable/content and recognize how good we have it Oh completely the same boat with the same sentiment. Well sure.  But if you are in the Senate where being a millionaire is quite common making only $350000 a year means you are the middle class representative.  Most elected officials are aristocrats. I made 8k more and paid about 1k less in taxes. We are getting back a 5 figure return(we had our third kid and file single). I don’t support the man and I wasn’t expecting this reaction but it’s ok.

So if that was done securely than the unknown number might not be such a big deal. But since they couldn't even take decent records it's hard to think they did a good job matching these children up.

Why hasn’t the generals name he mentions come up in past civil war monument discussions? I agree with him but wonder why this is the first time I’m hearing it. Perhaps one side dominates the discussion? Because he's one of the few Republicans willing to speak out against the Confederate statues. Good point. This is a republican example of p9litical correctness. You can’t express your opinion because then you’re on ‘their’ side. For a while you couldn’t say that the confederate flag should not fly over state houses. John McCain admitted to being politically correct on the 2000 campaign trail.

What would that look like? $10B is a lot of money. I know part of the problem is that the border patrol was forced to over double in size. They had been kind of what I hoped they were but when you grow so fast the culture gets away from you. Now a lot are out there with an attitude that they're the front lines of a war instead of bureaucrats with water and protein bars.I feel bad for nitpicking your final point in a list of ten. The first nine are talking points today and I expect they'll continue to be talking points and you've done more by putting them in an order and adding some specifics. This would be a full replacement of the current system if anything 10B is low No worries. Its the least thought outIt would look a lot like what is being talked about today except just double the money. Basically I'd put $7B over 5 years for border security; hiring and retraining BP DEA NSA etc agents; drones scanners port security; etc. Another $3B for DACA and the path to citizenship. You could include having immigrants that are naturalized pay back taxes give a tax break to those that came legally over the same period etc. The ""excessive"" amount is simply because I havn't actually budgeted it. What problem is solved with the $7B side? You've elaborated on the what (thank you) but not why.Drugs? Human trafficking? Illegal immigration? Appeasing the right for bipartisanship? We need tech to mostly stop drug trafficking into the country. I don't want a wall but I'm in favor of alternate options that are actually proven to help.

progress18,"I hate Trump as much as many and more than most but this particular move I can't fault. It's just recognizing that Putin has already left the treaty awhile ago already. Obama contemplated doing this as well. True but Obama was smart enough to realize Russia needed to be the one that voided the treaty so that we won the public relations game.  Trump gladly made us the bitch here to appease his daddy. Obama (and anyone with half a brain) knew that it was public relations at stake but also knew that he had a strong advantage not breaking treaties because we had NATO and a strong united front again Russian expansion and arms via Europe and other allies.How we doing on that united front again right now? Oh yeah everything has gone to shit with American diplomacy and unity in Europe has been weakened to tattered pieces by Russian-backed political and propaganda campaigns. And Putin is going to be laughing all the way to the bank. (The banks in the Baltic states that is.) But Russia basically already pulled out? Basically and technically are not the same thing as literally.  Russia technically pulled out by violating the treaty we literally pulled out by officially being the ones to end the treaty.  Essentially excusing Russia's actions. And we were supposed to do what? Let Russia just keep violating our treaty for some good PR? I don't oppose him leaving if other options are dead ends.He's not doing other options like heavy economic sanctions.  Crushing Putin's friends income and grinding the country to a halt into compliance.This is just giving Putin what he wants. The restrictions officially gone so nothing to be brought into compliance for later.Which isn't surprising of course but the point remains that forcing compliance is easier with the restrictions as a guideline.  Now they're gone. Except now we can't use ""they're violating this treaty"" to put international pressure on them or claim any kind of high ground on the issue and who knows maybe their violations were pretty tame compared to what they're about to do. Tossing out rules/laws/treaties because one party is breaking them seems like a bad precedent to set. The other option is to put increased pressure on Russia which this administration won't do. Looks like another win for Putin to me. The problem is..  what's the long game here? More nukes? Less controls?Seems to be a bad choice. Indeed- even a broken clock is right twice a day and in this case I don't think the knee-jerk opposition to pulling out of the treaty is justified.Russia was already in violation of this treaty and has been playing chicken with us and with NATO for a while now. They keep pushing their luck to gage our reactions and figure out how much they can get away with.I worry that we need a skilled statesmen in charge who can be tough on Russia without overcorrecting and being needlessly confrontational or belligerent. I don't think that's a knife edge Trump is capable of walking (even if we give him the benifit of the doubt and assume he has no personal connection to Putin's regime) What do we gain by pulling out? Seems like a love that justifies Russia's pullout? NATO needs to become something other than a ""the US protects us"" organization. We need a skilled statesman that will tell Europe to stand up to Russia as Europe. That ain't happening. The Germans don't want to freeze in the winter. You may hate Trump but you are as much a sucker than he is. By withdrawing Trump gave Putin a tit for tat essentially exonerating his prior violations. Those who have been in this game for far more than you and me say he gave Putin another huge gift. Any new agreement will be based on a new baseline since the old agreement was discarded now by both. Calling names doesn’t win arguments. And 1/3 of Americans will agree with everything and anything that the Republicans do. Yes same with democrats to though. You are probably correct although I am not one of those either. You know who's not opposed? Those making the weapons.The Congressional Budget Office estimated last year the 30-year cost of America’s nuclear forces at $1.2 trillion; more than $800 billion to operate and incrementally upgrade nuclear forces and about $400 billion to modernize them Is what the poll at CNN HQ says Doesn't matter what we want as long as he is sitting behind the wheel. Not quite. Senate makes it's judgements during impeachment according to what the public sentiment is since a senator that goes against the country's wishes faces likely ejection from their seat the next time it's up from election.Why do you think Trump constantly puts out distractions and attempts to discredit the investigations? Public perception is ultimately what will make or break him. Thanks for the cheering up. It just seems so pointless sometimes.  Can't wait for it to be over. Why do you think McConnell had been blocking any bills to reopen the government? He's been trying to shift blame over to Trump and prevent anyone in the party from having to go on record against the wall. It allows them a safer margin to get rid of Trump without riling the base too much.

jonfla,"But why bother. It’s not like we’re sending the message lately that being sexist or a little rapey or whatever will LOSE you the job. 😖 ....I wasn’t referring to Donald Trump but yes. Everything is not about Trump. That seems to go without saying but. It can still represent your views in later years yes. I’m not sure how one could logically imply that that would never be the case. Are you actually arguing that no one is capable of holding the same views over a two and a half decade span of time..??? If you’re NOT arguing that then what is the point of your entire second sentence? Yes of course something you said in 1994 ‘can’ represent how you still feel in 2019.Seriously?Now if she doesn’t feel that way anymore then bully for her. Considering that whether her feelings actually change is irrelevant to whether she needed to say it in order to BE CONFIRMED which was well the point what are YOU saying?No one said that she ought or not to ‘walk back’ her statement for her personal peace of mind. So you’re rebutting an argument that exactly zero persons were making. If she does then great! The point is the number of nationally known politicians having made pretty inflammatory comments about rape and gender in the relatively recent past who didn’t lose their office afterwards or at the time because of them suggests that purely from a statistical standpoint she doesn’t ‘need’ to make such a walkback. That’s all. It has nothing to do with anything else that you want to layer onto it like Trump who wasn’t mentioned by me and whose inclusion therefore says more about YOUR thought process than mine.But if you need to be ‘right’ in order to get some sleep then run with that. That’s fine.Good grief. Again that wasn’t the point but duly noted. Hard disagree. Everything isn't about trump but he is a significant part of the monstrosity that is the republican organization. Anyone who accepts a nomination from trump can no longer be taken in good faith in any way. Anyone who works with him directly or not is irreversibly tainted and any analysis of their actions must be viewed through the lens of them willingly associating with traitors racists and perpetrators of assault. I’m not a hundred percent sure I can tell who the ‘hard disagree’ is for but I simply meant that when the other commenter originally said ‘everything isn’t about Trump’ that ManChild McCheeto isn’t who I was thinking of when I brought up government figures who’ve relatively recently been under fire for being ‘sexist’ or ‘rapey’ without much damage to their careers. If they simply see the terms  and assume we must be discussing The Donald well...🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏽‍♂️I would not agree though that ‘everyone who works with him directly or not is irreversibly tainted’. Many people working for the armed forces the White House State Department etc were there before him weren’t hired by him etc. It seems unreasonable to expect the housekeeper to quit in protest. And the indirect ‘or not’ umbrella covers a lot of not-to-blame people. But yes as for the rest I admit to viewing those taking nominations from him for posts and those being directly appointed (cabinet members AGs for example) in a negative light by dint of willingly associating with him.I lived in NYC though; my dislike of The Donald was intensified by but predates his political ‘career’.PS: ‘SnarkOilSalesman’ is an awesome name. I’m not a hundred percent sure I can tell who the ‘hard disagree’ is forThe hard disagree was for the other user in the conversation.Many people working for the armed forces the White House State Department etc were there before him weren’t hired by him etc.I'm not referring to them as much as those who accept his judicial nominations have joined his administration or have been simpatico with his  campaign of destruction against the workings of our democratic government or the ongoing treason that he is carrying out. e.g. I thoroughly believe that any individual (there were thankfully only a handful who forced an approval) in the OPM who cleared Kushner or Sessions for security clearance needs to be immediately fired given a lifetime ban from working in the federal government and be investigated for treason.I rejoined the Defense industry out of necessity last year but I quit my job a week ago largely because I could not sleep at night knowing that I provided support for this ludicrous constitutional crisis that republicans refer to as a ""presidency"". Their child kidnapping scheme is repugnant and their proto-fascist revamping of ICE has been abducting families from across the border and then literally dumping them in the border city that I live in with no support. We have actually been passing emergency measures to find and revamp old city properties to act as shelters for the those affected by the crisis caused by those fucking brown-shirts.P.S.

ggershwin,Ironic Note: article is satirical Not by much. At this point satire is a nearly transparent layer only identifiable through explicit labeling. It's almost exactly like he was famous for being an egotistical idiot prior to 2015. He still is. That title though...... Reads both ways I think he’s proven that the past two years. Not sure where the lying ends and the dementia begins.. Probably depends on how good of a day he's having. Showed this to my dad his words “In other news water. Wet.” He came out against any kind of intelligence when he was born. Every time he opens his mouth he comes out strongly against intelligence. Both personal and professional. Pos Of course Pinocchio Trump is a moron in the first degree!  I can't wait for Mueller to put him in prison!  My Dinner With Mueller The Final Showdown Cartoon! Come on people. He's just trying to protect us all from the Shape Shifting Reptilianoids that feed off our negative energies to project a hologram from their Moon Base Mind Control Battle Station in order to make us believe the world isn't flat because reasons. REASONS! He should have others from intelligence but not himself. Remember that one time you were wrong? Well that means you are always wrong or at least wrong whenever I say so.PS. Don't confuse facts with analysis intelligence does both (not the confusing part the fact finding and the analysis) Donald Trump is just a glorified version of those know it all guys you meet at the bar on the verge of being tossed out. Most of the time you ignore them but in Trump’s case he had money and managed to convince enough idiots that he was smarter than everyone else in the world. His supporters are still impressed and feel like he just split his hamberder with them. I think the article refers to information. Which coming from the US govt has been dodge. So Trump will direct foreign policy based on.....what?

cheweychewchew,"What a clusterfuck. Well looks like I'll get downvoted to hell but I don't think this is grounds for resignation. It was absolutely an offensive thing to do but if his words and actions in the 35 years since that event don't reflect a racist bent and rather an inclusive nature then it suggests that he has changed for the better. Learning from your mistakes and striving to be a better person are just basic parts of being human and if one offensive Halloween costume is the only evidence I don't think you should jump to forcing him out. It looks to me like people feel justified to execute someone for one racial slur. And that to me is an overreaction.Again that behavior should be denounced but we should not set the bar so low for forcing people out of office. Don't just react to a single headline and jump to your conclusions but look for context and evidence of a sincere change of heart. Yeah but then lying about it and obfuscating is.It’s a sensitive time for this stuff in the party and he has handled the controversy extremely poorly. This is not a call for resignation on the basis of morality from the Democrats. It’s a call for resignation on the basis of being at a delicate time when controversies need a scalpel not a sledgehammer— and Northam is trying to use a sledgehammer. We lose our moral high ground because of things like this.  It allows the MAGA crowd to justify their shitty behavior because “Democrats are just as bad.”  He must resign and leaders who are serious about defeating Trump in 2020 must lead by example. Stop worrying about your fictional moral high-ground and start worrying about winning. The working people of this country needs a strong democratic party. No.  Let him stay.  That photo is a fake at worst or an editing error at time of print at best none of which implicate the Gov.He had just put forth a bill protecting Planned Parenthood and within 24 hours this misinformation smear campaign goes viral?  Bullshit.  It’s a tactical political move by either Russia or the GOP.  All of which is fine>.What’s not fine is how Democrats are so fucking eager to turn on each other for mistakes that wouldn’t even make page 45 9f the NYT if they were made by a Republican.  Republicans are a bunch of pearl grasping snowflakes but they are homogeneous.  Democrats are a bunch of angry special interest groups fighting for a seat at the table who are more than willing to kill each other for that last chair./a very special fuck you goes to Christa Hillenbrand.  She took out Al Franklin over a dumb photograph and she was the 1st on board in this case calling for resignation.  She’s in the wrong party seeking the wrong nomination and absolutely needs to get the fuck out now before she destroys anyone else’s career to prop up her own insecurities.  She’s an awe full person with zero original ideas zero leadership zero charisma and zero character.//finally wtf is wrong with taking a few days to gather FACTS make an analysis report the findings and THEN see if a resignation is appropriate or if this whole thing has been Russians practicing their snipe hunt.  Jesus the black reporters/guests paraded on CNN today acting like their own mothers lives were at stake was some high level sanctimonious bullshit. The very same kind that elected Trump.Funny how people freak the fuck out over the tiniest mistake but when Trump  shuts down the government for a “wall” that is dumber and less useless than herpes it’s good leadership. Of course it is tactically timed. But that doesn’t mean you don’t take the right action. He first “accepted responsibility” before providing a sloppy revenging when people continued to call for his resignation.He wore it.This is stronger evidence than what we had with Kavanaugh frankly. Besides there is a true Democrat in place to take his place. Thank you for speaking a uncomfortable truth about the Kavanaugh ""smear"" as I'd not take many ""psychology phds"" testimony with more than a lot of salt. Kavanaugh was bad due to his ideology but not due to his presumed innocence over a spurious sexual assault claim that was never reported and his ""innocence"" is by law protected. Absolutely agree. I think he is a smart judge who has an ideology that may be dangerous (I fear he may embrace executive power over the other two branches for example) however the opposition was driven by the fear of his judicial and not actual evidence of the accusations. I think the belief in the accusation followed after the rejection of his judicial conduct and views rather than merits of the claims. I agree his response to the assault claims were judiciously suspect overwrought and perhaps proof that accusations were more true than not. His blaming a Left Wing conspiracy against him was proof of his ideological biases. Of course any real liberal would have voted against him due to his ""conspiracy"" thinking. Maybe I am not familiar with his conspiracy thinking but clearly media and the Left were opposing him so his conspiracy wasn't ""wrong"" per se.People opposed him and were not forthright with why. They sought out and supported reasons for opposing him. Some amplified it disproportionately to the value and reliability of the evidence.I don't fault him for his conspiracy thinking if that is the extent of it. He should have kept a cool head though when confronting it. I wouldn't use the ""media"" term too loosely. Fox is number one in the ratings and the Right owns the commercial Radio sphere. The so called ""left wing media"" is a smear too. They didn't help Hillary and Bill for sure considerating ""Whitewater"" and ""emails"". Hell Dick Cheney was hardly investigated for his Halliburton payments while he was leading the US attack against Iraq. GW Bush's proxies even got a leading journalist fired for investigative inquiries in GW's obvious preferential treatment while a serviceman in order for him to avoid being shipped to Vietnam. You really don't see why this is an issue? Oh was it him because he has said it was then said it wasn't. Which is it? Was he lying then or now? Once a racist always a racist. NOT ok. That’s not a helpful attitude. Every day I thank whatever gods may live above or inside of us for the massive powers of growth and change that we are afforded as human beings.I have seen people recover from abuse. I have seen people recover from addiction. I have seen people recover from hate. Inability to believe in change from others is reflected in a similar belief about yourself. For your own sake believe in change.I’m commenting specifically on your statement not the discussion as a whole. The comment that I was responding to said in no uncertain terms that racists are incapable of change. That’s what I was responding to. You wrote a nice comment but it’s unrelated to mine. The comment you were responding to was ‘generalising’ that ‘most’ racists stay racist and my point is saying the same thing.When people make statements like ‘black people are x’ they are nearly always generalisations. Nobody believes it applies to every person in the group. Im sure if you asked /u/Brownk56 they would tell you that obviously some people change but that MOST don’t. You're completely correct. It was a generalized comment. Some people do change but it's a safer bet to take that people generally don't. The things we have ingrained into our very being stay with us through life and it is very tough to make old habits die. One has to work incredibly hard just to make the thoughts of such remain purely hidden and unlikely to rear their ugly heads again. So there is no path to redemption? No second chances? Any act done in your youth taints you for life? This is a horrible world view. If you’re right we get an ok leader. If you’re wrong we elect a racist to govern us.Why do you expect black people to take that risk. Why not just elect someone who’s never worn blackface? If you think black people don’t care that someone wore blackface then I suggest that maybe you don’t know a lot of black people.If there needs to be public outrage for someone to do something in the interests of blacks then there is already an issue.Black people vote democrats overwhelmingly. Without the black vote there is 0 chance of democrats being elected in 2020. That’s why the democrats saying ‘it’s ok that this guy wore blackface’ isn’t ok at all. Alienating black voters is a bad idea. He is the Governor of a US state.  A major one.  Our leaders should represent the best of us.  Unfortunately that has become less true...I was actually OK with his apology and was on the fence on whether he should step down.  But after saying it was him and he was sorry he now says it wasn’t him and he never saw his own yearbook...   That defies logic and reason.  He is a liar.  He is spinning stories and trying to see what sticks.  He cares more about himself and his political career than being an effective leader.  This is exactly the thing Donald Trump does. He is the chief executive of the state.  How do you think the many people of color who work for him feel?  Knowing that their boss thinks the way they look - the way they were born - is something to be mocked and derided?  That the head of government thinks the very real racial persecution that happens to black people (and in some cases continues to happen) is a joke?  If that was my boss I would be disgusted.  That puts employees in the position of quitting their job perhaps risking their financial stability and pension or just going to work every day for “Coonman.”Its not a witch hunt.  I don’t think you understand what “witch hunt” means. Who said people of color all think the same?  No one in this thread.  You are employing what is called a “strawman argument.”  You are refuting an argument that no one has made.You then go on to generalize about “Millennials.” You say some of them are dumb and read Huff Post.  Probably.  In a population in excess of 10 Million many things are true.  Some of them are probably tall.  Some are probably short.  Some have green eyes.  That’s not an argument.If your goal is to optimize the running of the state you want a leader who will choose the good of others over the good of himself.  Governor Northam had proven in the past few days that he will act in his own self interest  instead of the interest of others.  You can argue that the foolish racist he was decades ago is not the man he is now.  But it is undeniable that his lies and ridiculous sequence of “admit apologize retract forget” proves that be is a selfish man now. Not in 1984 but in 2019.  By your own criteria he should step down. Yeah no. Sometimes racist jokes are just racism with a punchline. Fuck him and fuck anybody bending over backwards to defend him. Nobody in the last 60 years thought dressing up in fucking blackface and a KKK getup was A-OK except racists it's not like being anti-blackface is some millennial thing we just made up at the last SJW meeting and forgot to tell your racist defending ass.""Politically correct witch hunt."" Is that you Tucker Carlson? When you obtain a position of power especially in government you are supposed to be there for ALL of your constituents whether they voted for you or not.Racists should not be allowed serve in government as they will not do that.People aren't perfect and everyone has events or issues that reflect negatively on them personally. As long as they can be seen to have changed for the better (long term) since that event it shouldn't hold them back.Saying that racists and overly religious types (zealots) should be kept from office as they cannot work for the benefit of ALL.Personal opinion only feel free to disagree but its mine More time is needed. This horrible photo in a land where slave owners dominated also reflected the medical school society of yore. The governor is not racist and the photo would not be published today. If you’re not offended by blackface and klan robes it’s you who has the problem. Can someone not make a poor choice in their youth and have a path to redemption? As long as hes not currently doing it who gives a fuck. I would love to vote for a democrat but you people are so goddamn fragile and you shoot yourselves in the foot at every opportunity. And no im not offended by a shitty joke someone may or may not have made in college. Racism is not a shitty joke my friend. Who cares? it Hurt no one and hes not currently doing it. Stop letting the conservatives and trolls run your party If there are no consequences for racism in the Democratic Party then we are no better than the Republicans. How do you not see this? Stop worrying about being better than the opposition and start worrying about winning. There are millions of struggling people in this country who could use the help of the democrats. Knocking out one of your own powerful members because of a minor act of racism that hurt no one is a poor tactical decision. Workers rights unions healthcare education all things far more important than being ""better than the republicans"" Racism has hurt millions over the years and it’s things like this that give cover to other racists and weaken the party’s ability to achieve what it wants to achieve. We can support unions universal healthcare good education and good jobs for all AND take a firm stance against racism. It’s possible to do all of it. We don’t have to choose. Have we learned fucking nothing from the catholic/native incident? Fuck. Chill out. Wait for facts. Of course I'm not suprised to see liberals defending a racist while making up lies that Trump and his supporters are all racist. Ho Ho it's a Right Wing website that put out this hard to identify pic. The gov deserves a chance to rebut it. He already accepted responsibility before recanting.  He clearly doesn't know how photos or the internet works. I'm still pissed about al Franken ME TOO! I think he would have been a strong candidate for the Presidency in 2020. Let's never forget that it was him asking pressing questions that led to Session's admitting that he had previously-unrevealed Russian contacts and therefore recusing himself from the Russia investigation. If not for Al doing his deliberate detailed questioning the Mueller investigation might never have begun.As I recall Franken's offenses were almost nothing. He immediately called for an investigation of his alleged offenses. I SO wish he had hung in there for that. Ehm. No. The difference is (as dead_pirate also wrote) that the blackfacing 35 years ago actually didn’t harm anybody but only (now) is offensive.

progress18,"No it's clear. He doesn't. I was gonna say it's painfully obvious he doesn't know shit. Or doesn't care. All of this ""he's playing 4D chess"" is utter nonsense. The guy is a spoiled adult-baby who is the epitome of a snowflake. No wonder the Republicans love him. He can be told anything and he will believe it. Federal debt is part of a very long and ever growing list of things he does not understand and will not understand despite these things being central to the job he has. What's even worse is that he doesn't know that he doesn't know these things and often just believes whatever fool thing pops into his head is correct and will not listen to experts on the topic. That is dangerously stupid territory. He only understands two things:Something good - He did itSomething bad - Dems fault It remains unclear if Trump fully understandsLet me stop you right there. The answer is no. Whatever it is you're talking about Trump does not fully understand it. He doesn't even slightly understand it. And he doesn't want to understand it unless it'll make him money. I think it's pretty clear he only understands how to lie his way into something and ruin it trying to deify himself. It’s almost like he hasn’t learned from his bankruptcies.Edit: fixed it. What do you mean ""almost""? Nobody know more about debt than Donald Trump. He said so himself. It is unclear if he knows how a faucet works Well that’s a safe bet the tricky thing would be to find something he does understand! Well it's clear that his tax plan explodes the debt and he does not care. The Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was supposed to come out with a report that would show that the Trump tax cuts would not add to the debt ..... still waiting for it. He understands putins orders. It remains unclear if anyone in the federal government fully understands how debt works. Fixed that title for you. I think they understand it just nobody cares at this point. The federal debt is actually simple. We spend most of our money on military and military related projects. If we cut military spending by 50-60% we could pay off our debt in 15-20 years. It's and ugly world and we won't do it until we absolutely have to. He doesn’t It remains unclear if Trump fully understands how to understand anything at all!

progress18,"It'll never happen but it's fascinating nonetheless. Even if they don't toss him he won't win in NJ. I think its a good play though still because if they take him off the ballot it will reduce the amount of republicans going to the polls and therefore effect down ballot races While I feel he should disclose his taxes this isn't something I could get behind at all. It's blatant election manipulation.If they pass a law for it so be it. But to do it in order to suppress voters and impact down ballot races is completely wrong. It's no better than the bullshit some of the republicans are pulling with voter suppression. I’m with you.  I hope we don’t get into these kinds of scummy tactics in 2020. If we do we will spend 4 years trying to defend the election or worse lose because it turns people off.Let’s win legit. Please. Yeah the last two years have really changed my tune with republicans. I voted for Trump because I just couldn't stand Hillary. Now it's a dumpster fire and no one is standing up to him (when I expected them to moderate him). I honestly am hoping for Mueller to have something impeached or resigns and some semblance of order returns. You might not like Pence but at least he's more level headed in a way.I just hope Democrats don't take us way too far left because certain things with their platform I really can't support I'm mixed for the most part on issues. But then again I'm just one person. Democrats are looking to go further a s further left. If only there was a decent libertarian. Howard Schultz probably the closest we can get. I was a registered libertarian in the early 2000s. I’m an atheist so I’ve never been a republican. I would consider myself 15 years ago to be fiscally conservative and socially liberal. That’s what libertarians used to be.I’ve grown much less fiscally conservative as I’ve reached middle age. I’d still like to see the deficit dealt with but not as opposed to taxing the very wealthy to help the very poor anymore.I agree that the Democratic Party seems to be swinging further left than I’d like to see. Maybe even far enough to lose another election if they’re not careful.Libertarians are mostly just anti-government wackos now. Most of them would let children starve in the street in order to reduce government.Maybe they’ve changed or maybe my eyes are just more open now. I’m just not sure.I can tell you without any hesitation that I will vote for the candidate that has the best chance of unseating Trump. That is the only topic that will factor into my 2020 voting. That’s a pretty sad state of affairs. Some things I can get behind but some others I really dislike. Being the only candidate to refuse to do is a bigger manipulation. I don't view it as direct manipulation of voters. Deceptive yes. Doesn't actively push people towards NOT voting but makes him out to look/be a shady candidate. He won't release them because he knows it will prove his lies about being a billionaire.  As such he is lying to America (shocker I know) and in doing so directly manipulating the voters. Ok I see where you're going. Voter manipulation vs election manipulation. That I could agree on. Still standing on my ""this is a bad idea"" but agree that him with holding his taxes is the only way to keep his persona up.Honestly I believe he's a billionaire hands down but I am guessing he pays very little taxes through accountant wizardry/manipulation. The only one who claims Trump is a billionaire is Trump.  No other metric supports that claim other than him just saying it. This clearly isn't voter suppression. Voters can still choose to show up and cast votes for down ballot races. Yes yes it is. He literally just stated ""it will reduce the amount of republicans going to the polls and therefore effect down ballot races"". The intent is to do it in order to disincentive republican voters. If the intent is to make candidates more transparent then I am fine with it.That's no different than saying ""sure we'll close a polling place in this neighborhood they can just drive to the next town and vote"". That neighborhood just ""happens"" to be heavily minority voters. While I am not  in favor of this move I do think it is completely different than closing a polling location gerrymandering and all the other legitimate voter suppression tactics used by republicans. The fact remains that the poll is still there...choosing not to vote is an individual choice.Lets also not forget that because of the electoral college voting for the president means jackshit anyhow. Voters actually have a voice in the down ballot races. Yeah I mean I see your point they are not completely equal. My point was more so towards the ""intent"" you posted about. Your whole intent was to convince people to not even go so they don't vote for other candidates.It's comical though because if this was flipped everyone would be grabbing pitch forks if Republicans some how figured out a way to remove a Democratic candidate from the ballot to impact down ballot races. You can't have your cake and eat it too. As much as I don't like the guy or his actions the past two years this is dirty tactics.I'm sure people will say ""Well they did it too"" but come on that excuse ended in grade school. I don't agree with anyone doing anything to push people to NOT vote we should be making it easier and pushing for more people to vote. I really hope they don’t do this. This is exactly the kind of thing I would expect from Republicans to suppress democratic candidates. Let’s be better than that. Agreed with everything you said. If you wouldn’t want something like this to happen to your candidate don’t set the precedent now. Why wouldn't we want this to happen to our candidates? They should release their taxes. This would be much different to make this law when there is no incumbent President. If we want to make a law that says we don’t want candidates that don’t show their taxes so be it.Changing the rules to try to create a disadvantage for a sitting president is clearly voter suppression.Let’s make this a rule for 2024 if we think it’s important.We hate trump I get it. Let’s try to keep our heads clear though.  If we can’t beat him based solely on his current performance we are screwed anyway.We are proponents of removing gerrymandering and voter suppression right?  Let’s not try to come up with new ways to be shady. Disadvantage the sitting president?They're his taxes. We want all presidents to release their taxes.

progress18,"Fox ConHow appropriate https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/132-negative-mount-pleasant Thank you for this! I wondered when I saw this news if it was the same area. Wow. Thank you for posting.I just finished listening to this and it really sickens me that the local residents had no real say in this whatsoever and are basically being robbed by their elected officials while providing corporate welfare for a fortune 50 company.  The initial math was $200000 in tax incentives (paid by residents) to Foxconn for each ~$50000 job. Since they aren’t going to employ but a fraction of the number of people the tax calculation was based on I wonder if the incentives decrease as well or if that is a fixed number baked into the deal? So who in their right mind would honestly expect a company from a country with one of the largest wage depressed labor pools in the world to locate a production facility in the USA without some ulterior motive? The gop? Oh wait..  you said ""right mind"".. no one. Scotty doesn't know!Scotty doesn't know! (anything) Ahahahahah... the people of Wisconsin will be paying Foxconn a shit ton to bring in scientists from China and California to work there.You deserve this Wisconsin. Go pay off your Chinese masters with your tax dollars. You deserve this Wisconsin. Go pay off your Chinese masters with your tax dollars.No we don't.  And the Republican assholes in our state legislature are already blaming the new Democratic governor for the deal going south which is such insane bullshit that unfortunately a lot of conservative voters will go along with it. They voted for Walker was it three times? Two elections and a recall?You need to be shoving this in every conservative's face you see.They got what they voted for. Alas that is correct.  The Democrats didn't help by running the guy (Mayor of Milwaukee) who lost to Walker the first time again for the recall election and running the CEO of a bicycle company for his first re-election.  I'm glad that the new governor after Walker's horrible track record with public education was the head of the Department of Public Instruction previously. All of those guys would have been a ton better than walker. The CEO is a woman but yes anyone would've been better than Walker save for some asshole like Paul Ryan or Ron Johnson. If they graduated from college they were instantly more qualified than Walker. The difference between a liberal and a leftist.A liberal cares about elections. A leftist cares about the people those elections impact. Elections impact those people.Caring about people and losing elections is just concern without action. The ""thoughts and prayers"" of the political sphere. Who said anything about doing nothing? Activism and direct action are historically proven to be FAR more effective that just elections.If all your action is centered around voting every 2 years then you might as well be sending this and prayers. You'd be just as effective in inspiring change. But hey you said it yourself you don't care what happens to the liberals and leftists of Wisconsin.Also I do vote. Elections are a 24/7 365 thing now.What activism has made a difference in the lives of Americans? Activism got you the minimum wage the 40 hour work week sick leave clean emissions regulations the civil rights act...Should I go on? Because we're just scraping the tip of the iceberg here. Lol so did voting. You dont vote those things roll back. Show me one bit of proof that voting obtained any of those achievements.And again I also vote but just voting every couple of years and doing nothing else is just is about as effective as shooting a squirt gun at a wildfire.

progress18,"Could you imagine the response from Mitch McConnell if Obama had done this? It's a fact that Trump invited high-ranking officials from Russia (plus Russian press while excluding US press) into the Oval Office and then provided them highly-compartmentalized intelligence information that the US hadn't even shared with Congress or our allies.When challenged Trump insisted he had ""an absolute right"" to do so.This disclosure profoundly damaged the US's credibility as a trustworthy participant in international intelligence-sharing. And this was neither the first nor the last time Trump stuck a knife in our relationship with our own and our ally's clandestine services via his reckless habit of showing-off via public leaks and private disclosures.This was the same meeting where Trump assured the Russians that he'd fired the FBI chief ""a real nutjob"" and in doing so he was confident that all that ""Russia pressure"" would be taken off.It is impossible to overstate the momentous nature of that meeting.The president staked his position with Russia and against the FBI the US clandestine services the free press and our longstanding crucial allies in antiterrorism intelligence-sharing.Presidents have powers and prerogatives — not rights. Even so the president's choice to aid an enemy foreign power at the extraordinary expense of US institutions and alliances is not something any American is permitted to do.It is treason even under the exquisitely narrow definition of the Constitution.And RepublicansDO.NOT.GIVE.A.SHIT.One way or another this is going to end up with America becoming a one-party state. I don't much care for either outcome. If Obama did this he would be dodging bullets from the right. With an express train to impeachment. His face would shrivel up and suck back into this throat....wait ""No puppet. No puppet. YOU are the puppet!""-Puppet Hillary really needs some credit for this one... she tried to tell us. That's exactly the thing a puppet would say! Thank you Republicans for both defending and enabling this President to put himself and Russian interests ahead of America. did donnie swallow? About Putin's cock holster or about swallowing? Get that traitorous motherfucker out of the Oval office.What a vile despicable administration.Mark my words: he will start a war with Iran to divert attention from his treasonous behavior.He should have a heart attack already.A big one. People are going to be really embarrassed when the truth comes out that these two just genuinely love each other and want some alone time. What blows me away is how conservatives defend and dismiss this shit.I will go to conservative sub reddits to try and get some outside perspective from time to time and I frequently see the argument that ""butt hurt libs"" are just totally fabricating the whole Russia thing yet time and time again evidence keeps popping up of suspicious clandestine dealings/meetings with Russians/Putin.It's like if you suspected your SO of cheating on you and they deny it yet you find all these calls on their phone from the suspected cheater which they denied ever talking to. You would have to be an idiot to not think something was up... yet here we are The more important moral to your story is that if someone feels the need to go through your SO's phone in the first place you're in a very unhealthy relationship. Put the phone down save your dignity pack your bags and kick rocks. Either they are are an unfaithful asshole or you're a paranoid lunatic. Either way ending it is best.As for the arguments you describe those are the bottom of the barrel conservatives. As a rule there aren't any meaningful arguments among the conservatives on social media outside private discussions. Although they are not represented well by their stupid branch on social media there are a good number of anti-Trump and pro-some stuff Trump conservatives. They don't poke their head out too often because both sides are rabid right now but I know a few and in spite of my being progressive they are quite nice and highly intelligent. Yeah even the ones who like Trump. That's because what they like is that he's not a traditional Tea Party GOP president. The ones I know aren't very pleased overall right now because of the lunacy going on but they make a few interesting points we on the left foolishly ignore.Their arguments summed up (don't hate the messenger).While we can prove any number of high crimes related to obstruction and financial corruption the narrative we try to sell as Trump being a ""Russian agent"" is fairly silly (this is true). We can prove he used his status in the campaign - and later in the White House - to enrich himself in Russia as a result of people elsewhere no longer wanting to do business with him. He also very likely used the oval office to repay those favors giving government contracts to Russian oligarchs (everyone agrees this happened and he should be removed for it). Once you get past the greed based corruption though the Russia narrative gets thin fast but the obstruction and corruption are more than enough to remove him from office.Putin hasn't gotten anything directly from the White House and in fact we're in the beginning of a strange standoff over Venezuela and all the oil. The election tampering started well before Trump was a candidate and we know it was intended to sow division on both sides not to favor Trump. Putin was happy Trump won because it weakens America and he's probably gotten a piece of the money from the deal on government contracts. That'll be impossible to prove but it's a safe bet.As we've been slobbering on ourselves over things like ""collusion"" (which of course there's no such crime in the US code but that's ok) and our certainty of the outcome we forget about the worst possible outcome that the media has been a little irresponsible (as we've seen lately) and we don't get the result we're expecting from the Mueller report. That's the nightmare!All the Senate needs is mild cover of the ""liberal witch hunt"" in the form of Mueller's report not proving beyond any doubt one of the following (these are what ""collusion"" refers to):Criminal conspiracy - (implicit or explicit) agreement between two people to take part in a crime.Aiding and abetting - (accomplice liability): helping someone commit a crime (overt act required).As pointed out to me both of these are good for everyone who is not willing to support Trump if he committed a provable crime (and us who want him out). That's because each of these covers the people who took part in a crime. Getaway driver is just as liable as the bank robber.You still need to have one criminal act to tie one or both of these together. There's no shortage of these provided we have actionable proof. Defrauding the government will probably be a fairly easy thing to prove but there's a problem. Mueller's report is very limited in scope. Luckily we have a solid fallback in the Logan Act which would be under his scope of work. Don't forget just because we know about dozens of crimes doesn't mean they will be included in Mueller's report. It doesn't mean that piece of shit in White House will necessarily have something tied to him.The conservatives closed their argument with something interesting. While almost all of them said they believe Trump should be removed but they believe (probably correctly) that we've boxed ourselves in. If we don't get actionable evidence from Mueller's report (doesn't matter what we think should happen only what can happen) Trump will see a huge resurgence from the base by selling the story of the ""witch hunt"" (could happen). If we're successful at removing him we rally republicans around someone more dangerous and more electable in Pence. If the former happens we lose all credibility and we're dead in the water because further investigation by Congress losses us a lot of moderate voters we need in 2020 (again probably true). If it's the latter we are at a significant disadvantage in electoral math and we have a religious zealot running the country instead of a corrupt orange imbecile.Plus there's the reality of the Senate not having to hear a trial for articles of impeachment or removal from office which brings up the ability to indict a sitting president. There's a lot of nuances we love glossing over. We're pretty blinded by justifiable anger right now but we should prepare for the unlikely but very real possibility that report isn't what we think.Sorry it's so long that's essentially the arguments of intelligent conservatives (endangered but they exist). Thanks for your replyfirst regarding the cheating SO analogy my point was that Trump and his administration have lied about their involvement with Russia and really cant be trusted as a SO who has lied about involvement with a suspected cheater. It's just an analogy and not a personal anecdote or anything.Furthermore just because Trump is not a ""russian agent"" does not mean he has not betrayed the interests of America and her Allies by providing support/lifting sanctions to Russia and the Putin regime.With what we know already it doesn't appear he had Americas interests at heart and with all the lying and secrecy surrounding Russia from him his people and the GOP it sure doesn't look good.Moving the goalpost to say that ""well he isnt an actual Russian spy"" undermines and disregards the fact that he has not acted with integrity in his role as commander in chief and the fact that his wreck less decisions (regarding foreign policy related to Rusdia and our alies) have weakened America on the world stage and emboldened Russia.Based on what we already know I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if Trump and many members of the Republican Congress accepted money from or are compromised in some way by Russia and my original comment was to highlight how their behavior indicates something fishy is up and every conservative I talk to pretends like this is business as usual when we all know it's not. You're absolutely right about Trump's behavior. Their point to me was about the dangers of the optics and giving Trump a narrative to sell to a group of people who will look for anything to discredit the claims against him. We've been so vocal about Russia for so long that we have a genuine risk of losing the war of the public narrative if Mueller's report doesn't explicitly connect Trump to crimes with actionable findings. That's not moving the goal post because we've been the ones making those claims of Russian agent status in the MSM and social media for two years.There's no question he should be removed. That's not even up for debate. What they are saying is that the report must be 100% damning evidence of the entire narrative or else we're going to have problems. That's hard to disagree with. Anything less and we end up in a bit of a pickle because we give cover to the Senate to ""justify"" their not hearing the case. We know he's not fit for that office but that doesn't mean we will end up with actionable evidence to do anything about it. That's where the danger is for us. His base has shown fracturing and a Mueller report that doesn't show explicit evidence of an overt act could be trouble.If you are talking to conservatives who are pretending it's ""business as usual"" then they are only conservative in the loosest sense of the word. Die hard supporters of Trump are lunatics and unworthy of the time.I was actually agreeing with you on the SO example. I was saying that Mueller's report is our version of ""checking Trump's phone"" to prove he's been unfaithful. It's something we are doing but we need to remember that the danger of checking someone's phone is that you might not find what you're looking for and you might get caught not finding evidence of what you're positive is happening. At that point we become the ""bad guy"" for making accusations and not having proof to support it. Even though we know he's guilty it's about what we can prove. There's a risk however small that Mueller's report doesn't provide anything but vindication (in the form of a lack of explicit actionable evidence) to Trump. That's a potentially dangerous situation for us.tl;dr: we definitely need him ousted but we should be mindful that there's no amount of certainty that Mueller's report will confirm or be able prove that he's been cheating on us. This would make us look bad in spite of being right. ah I see what you were trying to say now.I do agree that we and in particular the media need to be careful with the rhetoric that they spin because conservatives will use any mischaracterizations of Trump as evidence to dismiss real evidence of Trumps wrongdoings. In many ways I feel this happened with Bret Kavenaugh regardless of if he assaulted Ford or not he was not a good candidate for SCJustice but because it couldn't be proven beyond reasonable doubt that he didnt assault her all else was ""forgotten"".I misunderstood your comments about my SO analogy and actually you make a good point.

J4rrod_,"I don't think it's radical to allow the decision of a woman's reproduction to be left to the woman and her doctor. From the transcript you provided that's what I have gleaned is that the bill leaves the decision making to the woman and her doctor not the government throughout the entire pregnancy. From my understanding of most conservatives keeping the government out of the decisions of our personal lives is a good thing. Am I incorrect in that assumption? Liberal here.I'm pro-choice but I strongly oppose this bill (as it's currently written).Kathy Tran said some outrageous things in response to Todd Gilbert's questions. It's absolutely insane to consider killing a full-term baby as it's being delivered - solely for the sake of the mother's mental health (which were the specific conditions she was talking about with Todd Gilbert).I don't know why some fellow-liberals feel compelled to engage in intellectually-dishonest mental gymnastics in order to defend what she said. It's completely indefensible.EDIT: Kathy Tran has changed her mind.  She is now saying that she misspoke. Previously she had answered yes to the question about her bill allowing for an abortion to occur when a woman is in labor and about to give birth. Now she is saying ""I should have said: 'Clearly no because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth.'"".This indicates a real problem with those liberals who defended what she said. She is saying that her initial statement equated to ""infanticide"" -  directly implying that anyone who defended her comments was defending infanticide. We liberals have to a better job of being honest and fair. We need to listen and think critically. When confronted with a new issue we need to judge it on its merits and not simply defend a position because it was espoused by another liberal. Conversely we should do the same when confronted with a position espoused by a conservative and not simple oppose it as a gut reaction. I mean if it's possibly harmful to her. What do you do? Demand the doctor deliver the baby and risk to her life and she has no choice?It's an exteme example that the congressman used and that's possibly part of the reason for the thumbs down but let's just run with it...If they had complications during labor and it was going to kill the woman if they went through with the labor and they had no other options... yeah I could see abortion being a viable option at that point.The congressman wanted to use an  extreme example... ok let's use it. At that point the baby is being delivered no matter what. It being alive or dead would not increase or decrease the risk of physical harm to the mother. I don't think that's totally true. There are many aspects to labor that could have different variables. Name one where killing the baby would decrease the risk of physical harm to the mother.Here is what a doctor had to say about it:📷     Omar L. Hamada MD MBA  @OmarHamada    I want to clear something up so that there is absolutely no doubt.I’m a Board Certified OB/GYN who has delivered over 2500 babies.There’s not a single fetal or maternal condition that requires third trimester abortion. Not one. Delivery yes. Abortion no. Lol. Bull fucking shit. Let me be clear on something so there is no doubt you're not a fucking doctor and you're full of fucking bullshit. I just posted a direct quote from that doctor... a very well known and well respected OB/GYN with a convenient link to his post. Your post in reply is very odd.Actually it looks like the link directed you to his twitter but not the specific post here it is https://twitter.com/OmarHamada/status/1088136519146188800 Oh that was his quote. I thought you were saying that. LolThat's one guy. A fox news guy. Are you a doctor? Does your opinion hold more weight than his on this? https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/10426234/ ""requires"". In all the cases in that study the baby could have been delivered by c-section rather than aborted and the health outcomes of the mother would have been the same.Posting that is quite disingenuous on your part also because as you well know the outrage with regards to this bill is that the new language opens up the possibility of very late term abortions for reasons other than life threatening issues. I have never seen someone argue so hard for the killing of an infant. And I've never seen a conservative able to have an adult conversation on this topic. Kathie Tran specifically stated herself “mental health” though not life threatening. What are your thoughts on that? Tran specifically said ""or physical health"".I think it's highly unlikely that there would be a third trimester abortion for mental health reasons but it is possible under the bill.The real issue here is tf hat its between a doctor and a patient. The doctor would have to see the viable threat. I suppose if the patient was extremely suicidal there could be a threat to everyone's life. Ah yes my bad on that but I don’t think a woman can say that she is suicidal and use that as an excuse to have an abortion I don’t think any right she has allows her to use suicide as a threat/leverage to kill her baby both the woman and the doctor have had nine months to make the decision.(Personally I dont think abortions should be legal unless it is threatening the mother’s health seriously or threatening her life) Yeah you don't think she has any rights. That the point. That's always been the point. That's why this is a useless conversation. You think she becomes unhuman when she gets preganant and the fetus has every right to kill her if need be. Tran has now said she mispoke.She is now saying that her original comments were effectively infantcide. Are you still willing to defend those comments? Yeah funny how you guys sent her death threats and she changed her mind.You're thugs who refuse to be civil.Tell me how proud you are of the death threats she received and how you leverage your threats to make cheap political points.Are you still willing to talk about how you value life while threatening to take it? Video The bill in question is simply amending language in a current law and needing one doctor sign off instead of three.  Late term abortions are legal in Virginia currently but only when the fetus has abnormalities and going through with the birth will harm the mother.  This isn’t a case of women coming to a doctor for late term abortion because they simply no longer want the baby.  The exchange you quoted was a very weird hypothetical question because by the time of birth the doctors have already known if the fetus has problems.  The abortion would have been discussed already with the mother in theory.  In other words the chances of this hypothetical ever happening are very low.  This bill really isn’t changing much in terms of causing new abortions.  This bill is not an attempt to make it legal to kill new born healthy babies if the mother wants that. Because you’re a troll.

Just wanna start off by saying I don't want to argue pro-life vs pro-choice or anything like that. Only reason I came here is because I felt this would be the best place to hear from some pro-choice people on this bill. 

Here's the text from a conversation between Todd Gilbert (R) and Kathy Tran (D) about the details of this bill (video link will be put in comment since my original post was removed for having a Twitter link in it)

&gt;Gilbert: So how late in the third trimester would you be able to do that?

&gt;Tran: It’s very unfortunate that our physician witnesses were not able to attend today.

&gt;Gilbert: No I’m talking about your bill. How late in the third trimester could a physician perform an abortion if he indicated it would impair the mental health of the woman?

&gt;Tran: Or physical health.

&gt;Gilbert: Okay. I’m talking about the mental health.
Tran: Through the third trimester. The third trimester goes all the way up to 40 weeks.

&gt;Gilbert: Okay. But to the end of the third trimester?

&gt;Tran: Yep. I don’t think we have a limit in the bill.

&gt;Gilbert: Where it’s obvious a woman is about to give birth that she has physical signs that she is about to give birth. Would that be a point at which she could still request an abortion if she was so certified? She’s dilating.

&gt;Tran: Mr. Chairman that would be a decision that the doctor the physician and the woman would make at that point.

&gt;Gilbert: I understand that. I’m asking if your bill allows that.

&gt;Tran: My bill would allow that yes.


Am I correct in assuming that this is radical? Most pro-choice people I've interacted with don't seem to believe in this type of abortion.

Yeah the whole point of laws is to change the current situation. “That’s what the situation is” isn’t a great argument against “we’re trying to change this.” There is a fundamental difference between being a contractor and being an employee.  The contractors took the extra money and accepted the increased risk.  I have been a contractor several times in my career and I accepted both. I am pretty sure that the contracts are clear about payment as it relates to government shutdown.If however the contracts provide for payment even in the event of shutdown then of course the contract companies and their employees should be paid. Again is != ought. There’s no reason that congressional infighting should mean people don’t get paid regardless of how far removed they are from congress. Again there is no reason to treat contractors the same as employees.  There would be no advantage to hiring contractors if they have the same job security as employees especially if you have to continue pay them a great deal more.Also I never said anything that sounded like ""it is what it is suck it up"". I was simply explaining why contractors are likely to be treated differently than employees concerning the shutdown - it is entirely economic. I am pretty sure that the contracts are clear about payment as it relates to government shutdown.Emphasis mine. That's the weak point in your argument. You're assuming something you have no reason to. Since I do not have access to the all the contracts everywhere I had to go with an educated guess.  My contracts (private sector not government) were pretty clear - any sign of trouble and I'm outta luck. I was dismissed within days of my employer losing an overseas contract - them's the breaks. So you don’t even have access to one?Then that’s not an educated guess. It’s just a guess.And we have absolutely no reason to believe what you’re saying because we don’t even know what your contract said. Wow didn't realize I needed court-of-law level of proof to post to a &^*& opinion board.I was $%* up front about the educated guess. I was $*^*&* clear I was speaking of my private-sector contracts not governmental.What the *&%)(& do you want from me?I'm as pissed off as most about the moronic shutdown - I was only making a distinction between employees and contractors because there is a *&^* distinction. You're just a @#$($ random person on the internet so I #$%& no reason to believe anything you &(&% say when it reads like #$%#$ speculation. The words on the contract matter so what you're saying is plausibly @#$%#& bullshit. You're ignoring the RISK we taxpayers incur in how much more we will have to pay contractors after we establish how shitty we sometimes treat them. A company always pays contractor more than employees due to that risk.  For the same reason one pays more rent than mortgage due to the landlord accepting the risk of maintenance insurance and property taxes. You're proving my point.  By increasing the risk to contractors still more the taxpayers will have to pay still more. Disclaimer I am not US based but worked directly with contractors in the UK for the Gov here.This exactly you become a contractor knowing that you are in a (potentially) high risk job with potentially 0 notice before unemployment. You are inherently the first staff to be cut for almost anything budget related. As such you are paid accordingly for your risk as contingent labour. Due to budgets we had to cut about 80% of our contractors overnight but that’s why they earn between 4 and 20 times the daily rate of a full time employee. (Granted they also have to pay tax and pension etc with that but still is more). Hell many of the contractors we had were with agencies that provided a small out of work pay.If you did work then you should be absolutely entitled to the pay.But if contractors suddenly got the same rights as a full employee then the contractor industry would implode nobody would hire them. The whole value of contractors is that they are a (supposedly) short term investment to allow companies to be more flexible with their staffing for when they need more resources temporarily. short term investment to allow companies to be more flexible with their staffingAnd then the laws are abused and many de facto permanent employees are treated as technically contractors even though they're pretty obviously employees.",0,False,t3_al1qv1,32,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/al1qv1/no_republican_senators_have_signed_onto_a_bill_to/,590,,No Republican senators have signed onto a bill to give federal contractors backpay after the shutdown,590,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/29/18200559/government-shutdown-contractors-back-pay

You know... except for the hundreds of thousands of people per year who die of cancer and the 1 in 3 people in the US who have hypertension.My mom died of cancer and my dad died of complications from high blood pressure. For this and so many reasons (if I had one) Trump can suck my dick. So what bitch Looking up PFOA and PFOS and I can’t find evidence of it being found in damaging amounts through independent testing.This is important for this reason: Why would they set limits on chemicals which would require testing of every drinking water system if there is no science to support its presence in the first place?There are millions of compounds that can harm us at some concentration that we don’t presently test for. The risk of harm isn’t the only hurdle to include into the limits. There needs to be justification.That said this does provide description and guidance of the EPA that should make such investigations more easily funded. They basically classified the chemicals as dangerous so it could provide excellent justification for future studies.That is where I think the research is at since I can’t find too much out there.",0,False,t3_akzhjb,6,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/akzhjb/trump_epa_wont_limit_2_toxic_chemicals_in/,222,,Trump EPA won't limit 2 toxic chemicals in drinking water,222,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/28/epa-toxic-chemicals-drinking-water-1124797
spaceghoti,"While I appreciate the sentiment (thanks Brookings) I don't think it's completely true. I was working without pay for five weeks as an essential employee (attorney) but the masses didn't seem to care unless there was a direct impact on everyday day people: delayed tax returns flight delays etc.You wouldn't believe some of the comments I received including:""It's just a paid vacation."" (All my leave was canceled because I'm essential so no.)""It's fine; you're getting paid eventually."" (We had no idea when it would end. My mortgage company didn't have a program in place for government employees so I was going to face late fees.)""This is what you signed up for."" (If anything people leave the private sector for the security of government work. Also no one signs up for a job knowing that they won't get paid on time on a regular basis because Congress or the President can't get their act together.)""Why don't you just not show up? I wouldn't go to work if I weren't being paid to do it."" (This is actually against the law.)It was really quite hurtful. I'm a military veteran and this was a way of continuing my service. (Also when I mentioned I had served in the military previously someone on another subreddit accused me of shooting people in order to go to college for free.) Veterans make up a large proportion of government civilians so this felt like a slap in the face. The apathy and ignorant responses from those not directly impacted made it worse.Edit: a word Thank you for sharing. I’m sorry you felt diminished  and dismissed. People can be shitty and short-sighted and selfish. Here’s to things getting better. And quickly. As a fellow government employee I heard some of the same things particularly on Reddit. But I did have heart-warming feelings from those immediately around me.I was anonymously gifted 200 dollars from the “furlough fairy.” I was also given a hundred bucks from a friend when I never asked for it. She said she just wanted to do something because it didn’t seem fair.I was also given a letter from my local community telling me I’m a valuable member of the community my job is important to all of us that I’m valued  and inside the letter was a 50 dollar Safeway gift card.So while I heard a lot of disgusting rhetoric from keyboard champions the people that matter...the ones I interact with everyday cared and they showed their support and love. It was incredible and very humbling. Yes I heard the occasional “paid vacation” comment but I would correct them by educated them on our situation which gives different perspective to those people who aren’t being spoon fed by news headlines. On some occasions I didn’t even have to speak up because people around me did it for me. This makes me happy. Are you in DC? I'm in NY so I suspect that there's an assumption up here that there just aren't that many federal government employees. Actually I used to be in dc and got away from there because of the craziness. I now live in Tacoma Washington. It’s such a nice place with a great culture. Separately --Regardless of whether there should be a border wall or not (I personally don't support having one) can you imagine the long-term political ramifications if Congress had given into the demand? Anytime the President or Ted Cruz or someone else wanted something they could just hold the government hostage until they got what they wanted!The government tries to attract the best and brightest. It doesn't always succeed because it's hard to compete with the higher paying private sector but it does in fact try. Shutdowns becoming a more regular occurrence will make it impossible to hire good people. The gop has fueled a ""hate of government"". The narrative is that they are all worthless leaches that do nothing.They thrive on boogeymen. And anecdotally a lot of trump supporters are very isolated.  They live in church bubbles and don't have a lot of contact with actual poor people or suffering people (oh the irony...).  If your view of the outside world comes from fox news and you surround yourself with like-minded people it is very easy to develop an us-versus-them kind of attitude. You don't get to run a party on hate and no compromise and complain if the other party gets pissed about it... and hates the way you opperate.I don't have to ""wager"".. you elected your president as a warrior to attack the left and never compromise.Dont declare war and be surprised when the other side gets upset or fights back.If you're looking for Democrats to fix this total salt the earth war you started... you're going to be GROSSLY disappointed. I cant tell if you're agreeing with me or arguing with me?The gop has ran exclusively in emotions and attacks. Yeah that's a bad basis for a campaign.Trump promotes the ""rejection of political diversity"" and we should be against that.Disagreement isn't treason but wild character attacks and intentional falsehoods are getting pretty close and that is what trump and the current gop peddle. They seek to confuse and disrupt conversation. Gaslight and twist all fair discussion.To have a valuable discussion and diversity you need a group of people acting in good will. Trolls can destroy a conversational ecosystem.You can't have a class at Harvard with three high school meth heads mocking the professor and cracking jokes in the back. And demanding that people ""respect their mockery"" only implodes all real conversation. The problem is... trump is against political diversity and a ton of gop trump supporters are too.The paradox of tolerance is that you can not tolerate intolerance.Supporting ""diversity of ideas"" when one of those ideas is to kill diversity of ideas""... is not a working solution. My dad mentioned similar things. He wasn't working. But he said he feels kind of guilty for not working and knowing he will be paid. All the comments you said he dealt with and I could tell they tore him up. From their perspective destroying your life is just a necessary sacrifice to save them from the brown masses - and to own the libruls. Exactly. We were just leverage to carry out their xenophobic dreams.I pointed this out to folks:""Migration through the southern border is actually at historic lows."" (crickets)""How is it an 'emergency' or 'crisis' if the proposed solution would take 10 years to implement?"" (crickets)... but according to Lara Trump we are just a necessary sacrifice. And according to Wilbur Ross it's only 0.3% of the GDP. It's not like we're actually people whose lives are being upended. Can you elaborate on it being against the law to not go to a job you aren’t being paid to do? Are you not allowed to quit? It should be noted that we weren’t getting paid in the Coast Guard and failure to show up for work or just quitting is against the USCMJ and we could face prison time for NOT going to work pay or not. That isn’t what I signed up for. Yes! Exactly r/BuckyCop! Article 86 of the UCMJ. It's the Taft-Hartley Act.Yes you can quit but you can't stay home and expect to have your job still there after the shutdown ends. We saw this when Reagan fired all of the air traffic controllers. Federal employees are not allowed to strike. Don't listen to people. People are stupid. My guess is that it took that long to convince Trump that they can vote. Republicans knew they just don't give a shit.  The people of this country will only move forward by leaving the Republican Party behind not forever wasting our energy trying to convince liars and maniacs that water is wet. Because republicans care about themselves only. And their party before the country. But themselves personally over everything. You are blind to reality. It’s not a generalization. Your party backs the wealthy at every turn. Obsesses over personal wealth and feeds the ideas of greed.Empathy is a dirty word and the gov is demonized and mocked with few facts and mostly emotion. Private business is treated like a God with complete ignorance of why we have regulations and the past that led to then.You are a party built on generalizations that you dont care if they're true or not. For someone that talked about backbone. You're highly theoretical and don't seem to have a lot of ""backbone"" here.Oh.. quantum computing and criminal justice reform..  well let's ignore the other 99.9887 percent of the gop platform and belief system!And the gop mocks your entire last paragraph.

cheweychewchew,"I'm shocked. Narcissistic Pathological Lying Hypocrite I know shocking isn’t it? That he knew! NOT. HE IS THE MOST HYPOCRITICAL BASTARD ON THE PLANET. The much better evidence was when trump admitted it in a debate. Trump often accidentally speaks the truth .. only ""accidentally"" tbh. Illegal immigrants are a basis for usually Republican owned agricultural operations. They are the ""pull"" in attracting low income illegal immigrants while Republican supported Oligarchs in Central America are the ""push"" in forcing North American immigration. Not very good evidence here. One of the fired people spoke to him. It would be reasonable for Trump to assume that the employee was legal if they had a policy reflecting the law.It sounds like unfortunately he was hired before they started using E-Verify or some other verification system. The timeline makes sense. Mid-2007 all federal contractors had to use it. I don’t think they were required to audit their employees though but I could be wrong.Those not familiar E-Verify was piloted in the late 90s under President Clinton. Enforcement against employing illegal immigrants ramped up under him and Bush and Obama to the point that large scale labor violations are becoming increasingly rare with the exception of agriculture and day labor.I suspect these individuals had very good documentation to back their false claim or (more likely) a supervisor that had a very corrupt set of tools at his or her disposal.However I can’t imagine it being worth anyone’s time beyond the supervisor and couple others to be aware and support it. Why would a CEO-level person care beyond setting a policy? Your comment is just you guessing a bunch of shit with zero actual proof. So let me do the same! I suspect trump being trump was looking to hire cheap labor he could exploit because the thousands of lawsuits filed against him before he became president makes it clear he likes to exploit people and pay them squat. Now that people are calling him out about it because he has this stick up his ass put there by campaign advisors about the wall and illegal immigration he has to pretend to give a shit about whether or not he’s hiring illegal workers.

JackFisherBooks,Yet the same aging population consistently marches to the polls to fuck young workers. Fuck them.  May they all die lonely and unattended in their McMansions. That's a bit harsh but honestly not seeing how to align motivations between the boomers and.. well literally anyone else. Either that or try to figure out a way to take them for every cent you can get from them.Sell them overpriced elder care services which cater to their sense of self importance.Unfortunately there are a lot of companies out there that already do that. Most of them called themselves retirement communities. Way to generalize and sound dumb. Garbage.  America needs fewer workers to restore labor’s bargaining power relative to management who have been gradually destroying the middle class since Reagan.  As well America needs to abolish temp work and staffing agencies while restoring unions and imposing a 70% marginal tax rate on income over ten million dollars.  That would be a nice start. Wholeheartedly agree with restoring the unions. You can't grow the economy without people to do the work and the people are already in short supply. Wages are low because employers manipulate the employment market not because of a lack of jobs. Pay to play.  Need to stop stealing from peter to pay paul.  You pay into unemployment and social security your whole life you should get it back. Than make having a family affordable in the U.S. I second this so hard. I make well over minimum wage but I would be screwed if I had a kid solely because of childcare costs. I’ve worked in two business daycares and one in-home daycare and I honestly don’t understand how anyone can afford it at all. I dont see why either party would be against this. Dont want to rely on immigration? Make having a family cheaper and more native workers will be born. Want your citizenry to fund more social and public programs? People will put more into a society that their children will inherit than one that strangers will inherit So so true. I’ve fantasized having children my whole life but now that I’m of an age where I can start thinking of having kids I realize everyday how much further and further away I am from ever being able to achieve that dream. I may be able to have ONE in like ten years from now. Diapers & food & clothing? No problem. Childcare and housing? Shit now we have a problem. I recently saw a post about how US women aren’t having enough babies to replace the population and there are obvious reasons why that’s happening. We can’t afford to just pop a few kids out and be housewives anymore it’s 2019 and the minimum wage is still only $7.25 meanwhile everything has been raising in price and costs for years. Both parties want to rely on immigration though. That's why the IRS allows multiple people to share a Social Security number for example. When you're wealthy and own the gov't you maximize your profit by squeezing the commoners. You make up a consequent lack in birth rate via immigration and you squeeze those folk harder. Then*Right? Or am I incredibly high? Would be nice if more of them could actually afford to retire and you know get the fuck out the way then. Sadly they thought 401ks were a great replacement for pensions. That hasn’t worked out so great. To be fair the non-government pensions also are turning out to be bad ideas too at least in practice. A lot of them have been horribly mismanaged and are now underfunded. The only reason any survived 2008 is because so few people were drawing from them and they had insurance plans. But they never recovered their values and the insurance plans haven't been paid back. During the next recession we'll see a ton of pension funds collapse.At least with a 401(k) you own the money know exactly how much you have and can invest more when you're young and adjust spending when you're older. The trick is starting when you're young - which many people still can't do because they're underpaid. Sorry not interested in giving anything to the Boomer gen. They earned their misery. This issue isn’t about giving to Boomers. This is about making our safety nets sustainable including for our own and future generations. We do that by outvoting the boomers till they finally stop being relevant. No we don't we need to tax wealthy people like we used to. doesn't work if they are all dead.

outofTheirclosetToo,"Rehabilitation ultimately Do you believe rehabilitation can take place for all or most criminals without exile or punishment i.e. under house arrest? Idk it’s way too subjective since it really relies on a certain mental state Are you referring to prison or the correctional system? The correctional system. Prison would be an avenue for exile punishment or both. I'm of the opinion there should be two paths for our prisoners:Path 1: Reform rehabilitation mental health services etc. Many nations have great success reducing their rate of recidivism by actually ignoring the ""punish everyone like a wild animal"" approach. This path is for those who commit not-so-terrible crimes.Path 2: Throw them in prison and tend to their basic needs as a prisoner but otherwise forget about them. No parole etc. This path is for your serial killers serial child molesters etc. This is only to be used for the monsters of society that cannot ever be helped. This path is for keeping the rest of society safe from those people. Rehab and exile. This question isn't really about my own views (I posted in multiple subreddits to get an idea of views across the political spectrum) but this is the closest to my own views. Offer rehabilitation to those amicable. Segregate the hardcases and career criminals from the general population What are some criminal rehab treatments that have been shown to be effective? Its been proven prisons which offer education job training and other services lower recidivism. Several news articles have been done on this over the years. Google it Could/should that rehab and education system be decoupled from exile of prison system? Removal from society. It should be restricted to just those whom are too dangerous to have in society. Using prison as punishment never works. To rehabilitate (on paper). What do you mean by 'on paper'? Can you explain? I was being sarcastic. It’s the ultimate goal but not always the end result.In the States a prison has four goals: retribution incapacitation deterrence and rehabilitation.  Retribution means punishment for crimes against society. Depriving criminals of their freedom is a way of making them pay a debt to society for their crimes.

progress18,"trump was right about running the government like he ran his businesses.  sociopathic corrupt and his employees aren’t getting paid.“Mexico will pay for the wall.”“Americans will pay for the wall or I will shut the government down.” all it took was a little blue flu among the air traffic controllers around DC and NY...who knew?  or maybe it was the chit chat about a general strike? I saw that too. Once people started not showing up to work and the concept of a general strike was in the air the government was somehow able to come up with a temporary budget in a day or two.There is a lesson here... Time for Dems to aggressively push Dreamers Act again. Don't relent. I think we should leave it alone mostly.  It's like many laws we already have some good stuff in place.I would just make the breaking up families and holding kids in concentration camps illegal. Proof? lmgtfy I see stories about identify theft and fraud but not the government assigning multiple people the same number. You're also the one making the accusation so proof is usually supplied to back it up. Did you click the link? I didn't say the govt assigned anything. Spam link. Try harder. Not a spam link. I hate Trump but there are real problems with our immigration process. We don't need a wall though. If we really wanted to stop it then just say to companies ""If you hire an illegal immigrant you are out of business"". I hate Trump but I don't even think this looks like he caved. It's only for three weeks then we are right back to where we were. Trump was literally the only person who wanted the government to be shut down and his capitulation stopped the shutdown. How does that not look like he caved?""It's only for three weeks"" nah man he blinked. The wall isn't happening. I agree with you. I felt like his speech was a slight change in narrative. He said things like we won’t have a concrete wall and we already have some in place that works well.We’ll see what happens but I do think he’ll change his wording going forward such that a small increase to fix the current infrastructure will be regarded as a win and I don’t think that’ll be a tough ask. How convenient that he shat the bed only a few hours after Roger Stone was arrested too. I guess man. We will find out sooner or later. I just don't see his mouth breathing supporters thinking that he caved on this. I mean he didn't go through on his threat which is to declare a national emergency and build the wall without Congress's go-ahead. Consider how many lines this guy habitually crosses and what it means that he didn't cross this one at around the same time that Roger Stone was arrested. Trump didn't nor will he have much in the way of leverage. The wall becomes increasingly less valuable while the longer the government stays closed the less people want it. If he tries to shut down the government the blame will fall on him. If he tries to declare national emergency the courts will probably bounce him around for months till it reaches SCOTUS and ultimately (Hopefully) Justice Roberts hasn't been compromised and takes the safe option. No wall...just a cave. Congress had an agreement to fund your paycheck Trump vetoed it triggering the shutdown. Pinning this on anyone but Trump or arguably McConnell (for not leading a veto-proof vote to fund the government) is insane. I agree that it was caused by the POTUS but it lasting 30 days wasn't just his fault. It should have been resolved sooner. You're too old to be this stupid. Trump literally took 100% ownership of the shutdown in December. ZERO Republican bills to stop the shutdown. Pelosi started the new Democratic House by passing vote after vote to try to stop the shutdown. McConnell refused to hear them and the government stayed shut down.This was 100% about Trump wanting the wall and not wanting to take no for an answer despite that he didn't have the votes. The people voted against the wall in the midterms. There's no debate here. Trump kept the government shut down for a month because of a tantrum and caved at the end.The fact that you perceive the facts as any different is either an indictment on your intelligence or on being grossly misinformed by the news you watch or read. The fact that you insult anyone with a differing view directly shows you’re the stereotypical liberal that is giving the rest of of bad names.I really dislike the “Agree with me 100% or you’re an idiot you bigot/racist.” Mentality that is of today. You don't have a differing view you're just wrong dipshit. Stop acting like people have to treat you like a baby when you have stupid opinions based in misinformation that you voluntarily expose yourself to.Stop being a fucking idiot and people will stop calling you a fucking idiot you fucking idiot. Have a good day maybe go outside and breath in some fresh air. Maybe check into your attitude. I get you’re so liberal it makes the rest of us look alt right. 👌🏻 Well the 5th branch of the military went without pay and I can’t speak for everyone so I’ll try to answer it the best I can. We don’t have the option to just quit that’d be going AWOL and you’d end up in the brig for desertion. A lot of people join bc it’s away out of a small town people join bc it gets them free college people join to become part of something bigger and people join to save lives.  Also since it was the first time this has happened since the start of the USA. No one knew this was an option. Also you can say adios to all the benefits an honorable discharge gets you. I work for housing and veteran's homeless services treats non-honorable dischargees as if they were never veterans at all... i didnt even think about the armed services...i cant see the world you describe..where people join the armed services for reasons that arent cynical and manipulative where the martial portion of our society is something other than the lap dog of the ultra wealthy and powerful but im sure good stuff happens as a result of the decent folks that are in themhow crazy. you cant even quit if youre in the army but these fuckwits can withhold your pay! Yeah you sign a contract are are more or less owned. All your medical and life needs are more or less provided. When you’re in the military it’s who you are. But honestly the vast majority of the military is good people.But to echo what others have said getting anything other than a honorable discharge or to an extent medical separation you’re basically screwed in the civilian world. So you’re trapped until you’re time is up. LET THEM IN 😍😍😍 DAE BOTH SIDES???? It'll be Trump's shut down since he'll be the one who calls for it. He's already made that clear.Nobody is going to change their mind about this. Whoever thought it was his shut down before will think the next one will be as well. Same for the opposite side.

bobbyw24,Out mannuvered by Pelosi? He did it to himself. She just called his BS. She didn’t have much of a choice. It’s either stick to her guns now or let him keep govt. employees hostage as an effective negotiating chip. He mistakenly thought his opponents would cave under pressure merely because they have compromised in the past to get stuff done. Yea it was tricky. Doing the right thing and not caving to Trump's extortion was really unexpected. /s Missed the /s there. let him keep employees hostageI feel like that's what he's doing by promising another shutdown honestly He shouldn’t have listened to Coulter Limbaugh and Hannity in the first place. There never should have been a shutdown. At the end of the day it doesn’t matter if he pisses them off it’s not like they are going to  tell people to vote for a Dem. What I don't understand is what all those people thought he could accomplish by standing his ground.Most people know that trump was the one who caused the shutdown at the last minute by suddenly demanding wall money.  Many members of Congress (Dems and GOP) had already left town thinking the original temporary measure to fund the government was a done deal. Everyone was taken by surprise by trump's 180. Nevermind trump's own statements about taking responsibility for a shutdown in the days leading up to it.He didn't have any leverage for negotiating. It was a really bad move. All the Dems had to do was keep saying no. How did they think it was going to work out in their favor? Art of the Deal tho he's the best negotiator. So much winning So much whining He was right. I’m sick of this winning. ...for Democrats! So much winning that he got tired of it. This could spell disaster he’s so unstable right now who knows what he’s capable of. What during the past two years already hasn't been a disaster? You ever hear of Murphy’s law? You’re right but right now he’s been humiliated in his eyes and his supporters which makes him even more dangerous Unfortunately I hear this a lot. The president weaponizing a government shutdown should never be rewarded. You don’t reward bad behavior from a temper tantrum throwing toddler because he’s unstable and who knows what he can do next. You put that little shit on time out as much as it needs to happen until he learns the world isn’t all about him. Maybe a swat in the seat too. He’s a textbook Narcissist and it will always be about him he’s incapable of Empathy and again will use the shutdown to get what he wants or an executive order  directed at taking away something people need. You’re right never reward his behavior he’s used it in the past to get what he wants but Nancy running the house now and she knows how to handle toddlers. And here I was hoping the alt-right might implode once he backed down... T_D calls this a victory for Trump. If I understand correctly Trump just outmaneuvered Pelosi so he can do the SOTU. Then he declares an emergency and gets his wall. …it is absolutely necessary that there should be full liberty to tell the truth about his acts and this means that it is exactly necessary to blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right. Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the American public. Nothing but the truth should be spoken about him or any one else. But it is even more important to tell the truth pleasant or unpleasant about him than about any one else.

texlorax,"My wife is a teacher and her insurance just denied her claim for a God-Damned FLU SHOT!  Yeah burn it down...burn it ALL down.... Same for my wife a teacher for 25 years flu shots were covered until last year now denied. Give her a medal and tell the insurance company to suck it up. Most likely her insurance will be canceled So you have no problem with insurance fraud? Yep fuck insurance companies and the assholes who own them. Well said insurance companies have been defrauding their customers for far too long. And you have labeled yourself an enemy of the people. Wow for trying to uphold the laws to which we all agree. Mob mentality at its finest. The laws written by the rich to make them richer and keep the poor down voted on by politicians bought by the rich.  All sold by the media owned by the rich.  That is what you call ""agreed"" on? Once again Wow. You seem unable to grasp the simple concept of theft.  I guess I would say ""Don't go crying to any authority when somebody steals your shit.""I have no idea why mine is the unpopular opinion.  Has Reddit gone anarchy? That is fucked up We punish people who try to help children? The world has really gone to hell... Because we live in a sick society where corporations are allowed to deny people life-saving medications to literally save a few hundred dollars. Something something death panels. They deny up front to make money in the long run. You can't afford it now so you'll wait out until it's worse and necessary. I get you but it's a slippery slope.

If there were more people with her amount of compassion this world would be a much greater place. She was NOT wrong this was NOT a mistake.  The system is broken if a child can’t get medical care for a highly treatable and potentially dangerous ailment.  I side with the teacher 100% and I would do the same thing. So you would knowingly commit a felony? Would you feel the same if she robbed a liquor store to provide the funds to help the sick student?  How is insurance fraud different? She was given probation for a year if she stays out of trouble it drops off her record.  Even the judge had a heart in this case.  A liquor store comparison?  You're trying too hard.

Ultimately the bank will suffer.  Is it ok because it is a big heartless bank/insurance company? Is your insurance company standing behind you? Blink twice if you need help.Seriously though if you believe laws must be followed even when they are morally and ethically wrong then fine but realize not everyone agrees with that premise.

progress18,"Trump bends to the rules Pelosi is just the person who made him do it.  The person who should have made him do it is McConnell. Trump begrudgingly does his job for once. I wouldn’t categorize Trump conceding that he won’t give the speech after the person who has the authority not to allow him to do it where he wants to do it as “doing his job.” Remember he’s still holding the entire government hostage for his idiotic wall. Sad! Low energy! He’s gonna fold like a wet napkin before it’s all said and done. This is the worst political miscalculation he’s ever made and he’s starting to understand Pelosi has him firmly by the nuts. Tiny though they are! Is there literally no issue he doesn't talk like a whining child about? Trump is putins pet. Master negotiator right there. The shart of a deal... Dominated!!!! I appreciate the sentiment but is it really bending to her will if even the president would be forcibly removed from the floor if he went without permission? The SOTU turned into the STFU! I dunno.  Trump doing this delays the SOTU indefinitely which gives Democrats another reason to keep the shutdown going. But this works in the Republicans favor who want it shut down to begin with. Why would you say the Democrats have committed to funding a wall? You can make the same argument for the Republicans too.  They should fund the government and negotiate wall funding separately. So government is going to funded until February 8th? I think that's a mistake on Democrats side because now they've committed to funding the wall whether they intended that or not.How so? Because if Trump is agreeing to temporarily fund the government in exchange for negotiation on border security he's going to see it as he's getting his dumb fucking wall. He will not give it up because his loudest and dumbest supporters believe he meant that promise and he knows if he caves to Democrats on the wall he'll look weak to the people who voted for him because he's a ""strongman"". If he falters on this and lets the Alt-White boogyman Nancy Pelosi get the best of him he has no hope of being reelected. His only hope of not losing whatever wealth he's built up during his time in office and keeping himself & his kids out of prison is a 2nd term.This wall is an issue of survival for him which is why the shutdown has lasted as long as it has already. By doing a temporary funding of government Trump is signaling he's acting in good faith (he's not and we know that) and when he doesn't get his wall the government will shut down again and then it will be pinned on the Democrats. Right now this is Trump's shutdown. Don't give him the opportunity to crawl out from beneath it and drop it on the Democrats. Just hold the line and continue to pick at his insecurities until he blows his stack and you win.The Dems have to force any talk of border security funding to legislation independent from funding the government. For one that's how our government is supposed to function and hopefully it will set a new precedent ending these bullshit hostage situations every year. border security is not the issue for illegal immigrants. the overwhelming majority of immigrants here illegally are overstaying their visas. that is the issue. Yeah but that's not a monument to Donald's ego so he doesn't care. Actually he is allowed...he just can't give it on the house floor. He can submit it in writing if he wants.

I'll criticize them on that but not on what happened in the video. That news story straight up got me too. I was completely outraged till I watched the long video. Just because you don’t like a person’s politics or attitude doesn’t mean they’re guilty of something. And what's annoying is that a lot of celebrities jumped on it and are still going on about it. They are refusing to watch the longer video and anyone who says that the original video was misleading is called a MAGA supporter.

davidreiss666,"I support a mission to Mars. I support an aggressive timeline.However NASA needs funding to do this and they need to be the ones to define and outline a realistic timeline which can be achieved for selection training design manufacturing development... etc. Also this: ""The journey from Earth to Mars takes about 300 days. Every two years Mars is at its closest point only 55 million km from Earth and it's the ideal time to send a spacecraft. Travel time depends on the positions of the planets and how much fuel you're willing to burn."" I get the feeling those kinds of details go over Trump's head. He literally took funding away from NASA kinda hard to do without any money In 2016 they got a bump of about one billion under Trump. The NASA budget is presently larger than what is was during Obama’s second term. The proposed budget for  is the largest in about two decades (however it won’t be funded to the full amount).They don’t have enough for a moon or Mars shot but he hasn’t hurt the overall NASA budget just mission areas he opposes (environmental sciences). I think they were referring to how NASA is currently laying off contracted employees because there is currently no funding for NASA. In 2016 they didn't get anything ""under Trump"" because he wasn't president. He didn't even control the spending levels for much of 2017. I thought you were quoting Donald there. I was almost impressed by him for the first time. Yeah trump doesn’t care about that. He just wants to say he put man on Mars. If he didn’t get sad that it couldn’t be done within his term it would have been pretty cool to see a president take such interest in space exploration. He offered them unlimited funding.I have mixed feelings about them declining. Imagine if they had. The aggressive drive toward Mars much like the moon of the 60s. What an achievement. What a pay off in new technology for us.However we now know how risky the Apollo program was. Those astronauts were all subject to a great deal of risk that we now consider unacceptable. Unlimited funding is not realistic or achievable on the Presidents word alone. So if he did do that any agency who understands how funding happens are right to be suspect.Regarding risks. The space agencies all have ways to identify and mitigate risks today that were not as mature or even understood in the early days of exploration. Has the appetite for assuming risks changed you bet.

mojo4394,"I think that there's a lot better areas to focus on than jobs overall. Particularly gdp and the unstable stock market.But.. you asked about jobs.One place is to use trump's own words against him. This one is a fun one to use against trump fans as he said it. Labor force participation rate which I'm assuming led him to say crazy shit like this:https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-unemployment-rate-may-be-42-perc/And the numbers have only changed a little since then.They really hammered Obama over the the labor force participation rate. Obama had a good number but they said too many people weren't even looking and gave up.This number is still bad and still around Obama levels. It goes up and down a little but no where near pre-obama numbers. Basically no recovery.https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/lns11300000Obama left it at 62.9 and in Nov. 2018 it was... 62.9. It went up slightly in dec. to 63.1 but this number is normally around 66 percent. We are no where near that and won't be.Granted most economists don't give this one much credit but trump fans sure loved it for 5 years.If they tell you that they don't care about this number then you'll need to remind them this was Obama's ""greatest weakness"" and that means that Obama's job numbers were damn amazing (just like many economists said).The other thing to mention is wage growth. Its not good.If trump is creating great jobs that would pay more...why arent wages growing?Whatever trump is creating is paying about the same as what Obama was creating in 2016.

progress18,"Why do we care what Alyssa Milano thinks? Regardless of if she's right or not why is this news? Yeah people what does Ja Rule think? 🔥👌 Yea... I think our media has been shooting our foot off since Bernie they don't seem to get it. Love not hate. Don't fight hate with hate. Uh huh. And what specific person is the victim of this ""mob mentality"" you decry? Did Alyssa Milano sic a mob on any individual? Or are you just complaining that it's horribly unfair to malign or be disrespectful to Trump cultists in general? It's bullshit to malign or be disrespectful to ANYONE without reason or proof that they deserve it.  Doesn't matter if it is a liberal being called a ""snowflake"" for wanting to help other people or a MAGA hat wearer at a rally or a woman walking into Planned Parenthood.  Shitty reporting and mob mentality has taken otherwise good intentions and turned them into a witch hunt.  If a news outlet wants ratings all they need to do is find a way to incorporate MAGA or #meToo or some other buzzword/hashtag bullshit.  Buzzfeed's recent reporting is a great example.  They put out a story that was largely disputed by multiple reputable news organizations but it was already too late the social media mobs turned it into some huge fuckin deal.  Now with these protesters and covington high students it's the same thing.  An edited video was dropped and the world erupted and then a longer unedited video comes out and all of a sudden there is another side to the story.  Irresponsible reporting from fringe outlets like info Wars  Breitbart Slate and Buzzfeed do nothing but appeal to the mob mentality of the people who champion their causes and do more harm than good. Although we sit on different sides of the fence THANK YOU for being rational as you are 100% correct all of these media outlets try to pull on heart strings and look to get knee jerk reactions out of people Absolutely.  Civil discourse is essential for a free society. Amen. It's not a fence it's an aisle. The leaders want it to seem like a fence. Both parties have conservatism and liberalism that the other lacks... we have so much more in common than most realize. I am a very conservative man and I came to this sub because someone cross posted this article.  It is great so see comments like this. Don't be fooled. The long version is still showing a bunch of kids being assholes. Being an asshole is wrong even on Reddit and there are repercussions for that in a well balanced world. But I understand that because of the social media aspect of today's world that the punishment may not fit the crime but being an asshole in front of a camera has larger repercussions than being asshole in private. That's just the way of the world we live in today. Absolutely I firmly believe that in this case the best course of action for both parties was to not engage.  Sometimes it's better to let people believe what they want as long as they aren't actively impeding someone else's right to pursue happiness how they see fit.  And while I agree that there are generally larger repercussions when someone is a douche in the public eye I still don't believe that punishment should be ruining their life especially when we as casual observers miss all of the context in a situation. At least not without good cause.   For example if a video comes out of a person taking a bat to someone chances are their reputation would be tarnished even if there is later evidence that the someone assaulted them or their child or something equally heinous.  We see snapshots of events and make even faster snap judgments based on our ideologies and when we are wrong it is catastrophic for those involved. Sometimes it's better to let people believe what they want as long as they aren't actively impeding someone else's right to pursue happiness how they see fit.It's like you believe in individual liberty common sense and refraining from forming judgements without looking a whole story...(In disbelief I just checked if I was still on Reddit). I don't know... I mean we're allowed to protest things in this country. And those kids have every right to be there and be exactly who they are. I was high-school kid myself once I understand what happened here very clearly and it doesn't take political ideology to understand exactly what's happening. In that moment those kids weren't being political as much as they were being legendary in their little high-school world. They got so caught up in it they didn't even think about the consequences of their actions about the effect they were having on a Native American Vet and certainly not about the guy filming it. They didn't know how much larger the world is than their little corner.I bet they understand how much bigger the world is now though. They're fucked and they brought it on themselves. I don't care if they're Trump supporters if a lesson in civility was learned it's worth it. sure you can protest but you can't walk into the middle of a counter protest start a ruckus and then blame everyone around you for the incident.  That's harassment.  Nathan Phillips didn't need to march his group right into the middle of counter protesters and these kids could have walked away.  And while I agree with you about learning a lesson in civility we haven't taught these kids that instead we taught them that mob mentality trumps everything else.  If a lesson in civility was to be taught than Nathan Phillips group would also be held accountable here. You're probably right that the only thing they learned was that mob mentality trumps everything. Eventually they'll come to the realization that when you form a mob mob mentality reigns. It's like the old saying ""If you go looking for trouble you're sure to find it."" And they found it. No I don't ignore that either.  I might be liberal but I am also trying to be a decent human being.  Sarah Sanders is a fucking twit.  Either she believes everything that Trump is spewing in which case she is a moron or she doesn't but has compromised her integrity to garner success.  In either case she needs to go.  However she doesn't deserve to be harassed and threatened outside of work.  Nobody does. You're shifting goalposts now.Also? I consider the employment of escrache tactics against members of a corrupt administration who are putting children into concentration camps to be entirely right proper and something we need more of. Sarah Sanders Mitch McConnell and the other servants of Trump should never be able to eat a meal in a restaurant in peace until they are out of power.They discarded any right to demand civil treatment when they began employing politics based on harassment racism intimidation and general barbarism.In normal times with normal politicians and normal politics I'd agree that civility is right proper and necessary. But these are not normal times those are not normal politicians and this is not normal politics. When dealing with a violent reactionary right wing populist movement built on ethnic nationalism and eliminationist rhetoric and actions the normal order of business is no longer applicable. Sanders and Carlson are absolute pieces of shit and need to go away but I have to disagree with you here.  Especially when taken in context with these very specific events.  While you are correct in your declaration that Trump has separated families at the border etc the absolute truth is that he wasn't the only president to do so and we should hold them ALL accountable for that fact not just Trump and certainly not Sanders in this case.  Blaming Sanders for Trump's idiotic policy is like blaming a waitress for the shitty cook who ruined your food. Tucker Carlson is not a politician. So who is moving the goalposts now? I don't think the kids life will be ruined but I do think the kid was being an asshole. In today's world being an asshole in front of a camera gets results that far outweigh the crime in some instances. You can blame the reporting the mob mentality or whatever else you want but at the end of the day if the kid had chosen to not be an asshole none of this would be happening. Also calling people racists when they didn't think like us didn't work out so well during the last presidential election cycle.  It's proven to be an excellent way to push people on the fence farther away. Thanks for this! I hate those MAGA assholes.   But the Klan hid their faces out of shame and so they could commit horrible crimes without fear of discovery.Equating MAGA hats to the Klan is just lazy and Godwin's law level hyperbole.   If you have people in MAGA hats lynching people and burning crosses then you might have a point.   When you make broad generalizations like this with zero connecting evidence you are helping these jerks look like victims. Not all MAGA hat wearers are racist but you can bet all racists are MAGA hat wearers. If you disagree with what your party has become don't associate with it and discourage the support of racist ideology and rhetoric. all racists are maga hat wearers.Do you actually believe that garbage? You don't? Yeah cus there's no racists outside the US. And also no racism towards white people. Saying lazy shit like this makes it easier for the MAGA assholes to complain about being discriminated against and just retreat further towards the far right. Which helps no one. Ummm the Black Israelites group are racist as fuck and they hate Trump.I think you mean most white racists are Maga hat wearers. Oh boy I sure have.  You may not have but those of us who watch a lot of street debate videos know all too well whi they are. I've watched tons of their videos online. Also if you live in DC they're out there. Wut?  Dude whatever side of the aisle you're on is irrelevant. Their entire shtick is that they're racist.  Like they promote it like Westboro lol So your contention is there are no left wing racists? Interesting. Do you think there are a lot of left wing people wearing  “ I’m with Her “ shirts who are pro border wall and revoking civil rights protections ? I didn't imply that at all. I'm specifically talking about the MAGA hat being something that racist people wear. I know.....but again I can point to dozens of examples of unlawful truly heinous acts by the Klan.    The reason it's reviled today.   When you get on people for wearing a hat and don't give concrete examples of why it's harmful or what crimes those hat wearers are committing then you make a comparison a joke.   It doesn't help to educate or change anything to blindly make connections like this.    It's an issue with using the weapon of the enemy (Twitter) to discuss any issues.   Just throw the most outrageous crap up there and don't care what sticks.  Can't compare them to Nazis?   Might as well go with the Klan.How about point out what they did wrong instead of demeaning and lessening what atrocious the Klan committed in their day.    Because if all the Klan did was stare at a guy and look like a smug douche then it wouldn't really be all that horrible. This. https://imgur.com/gallery/YaR7SA9“ not that horrible “ The people in your picture aren't wearing MAGA hats and they predate Trump.What horrible things did MAGA hat wearing individuals do that compares them to the clan?BTW the closest thing to that picture that's current is this...

The nation wont stand long willfully being led by a fool. It’s almost as though she can read AND chooses to spend some of her television viewing hours doing so. And it’s as if she interacts with people who engage her intellect and respect her achievements as a legislator & professional. That's damning her with faint praise. I wish she were more of a leftie but there is no denying that she is truly gifted at managing the factitious and wildly ideologically disparate Democratic caucus and can almost always whip up the votes to get critical bills passed. She's a truly excellent politician and a damn fine negotiator.While Trump is basically useless by any measure. Any measure? surely he is better at speaking over the sound of a helicopter or maybe playing truck driver. So is my toaster. Just sayin'. My dogs take smarter shits than the current president They are not playing the same game. She builds sand castles he kicks them down.

I've know toddlers who can color the US flag better than him. I'm not a fan of her personally but DAMN she is pretty good at her job.  She makes Schumer look like a bitch. Honest question how is she doing a better job? I have yet to see something good come from her on this. She has managed to sway the public against Trump and the wall while keeping Democrats united. Trump has managed to do the opposite. He takes the blame for the shutdown and divides his party on whether the shutdown is worth a wall.

Success is going to have to be measured in other ways and Pelosi is leading the conversation about how. What the actual fuck are you talking about?

Ahhh ... ok. Thank you.Goddamnit Trumpers are so fucking stupid it makes my head hurt It’s the usual projection.... it means that trump will try to flee the country himself before it’s over. That has literally been the case every single time so far. So basically Trump is planning to flee to Russia to about prison. Hell no. Russia doesn't want that whiny retarded pile of cheeto lard they just wanted to take advantage of the dummy like everyone else around him.He'll probably do like the rest of the nazis and go to Argentina. It would be the perfect end to their attack.The amazing thing is that after this wildly successful attack Russia will still be basically a third world resource based economy. They have the 12th largest economy behind South Korea behind California. Their reward for ""winning"" Syria is they have to support a ruined client state. Oh my god you live in a bubble No that was Don Jr hiding in Canada because an indictment is coming. Given how Republicans work I expect Trump to flee to Russia to avoid prison. The generally accuse others of what the Republicans do or plan to do. Yea he’s gonna be impeached any minute now... any minute... Nope. But it looking more likely. And once our of office he has no ability to stop the investigation it indictment.Why didn't Trump speak up when Cohen was lying to Congress?

They also give little attention to stories that hurt them elevate stories that frighten or anger the audience about their political scapegoats and frequently give reporting time to stories they know are false in order to plant them with the audience before eventually retracting them days later. u/tehSoupNazi outlines how Fox News originated as a mouthpiece for the Republican Party and has now evolved into straight propaganda for Putin’s Russia.There’s more evidence but I also realize that logic does not apply to fascists. As Nazi Minister Josef Goebbels defined propaganda must focus on eliciting emotion not reason. And what do you consider “anti trump garbage”?Reporting on the six thousand plus lies ’Rump has told since taking office?The guilty plea Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen took as a result of lying about Trump’s emoluments from dealing with Russia?How about the myriad other lawsuits that have afflicted your leader?I don’t know why I bothered backing up all this evidence with sources considering you refuse to provide any support to your bullshit claim. Like I have already pointed out fascism intentionally omits all form of logic based evidence. You need to realize there is no liberal media and instead there is a corporate media that only deviate from one another by how much credence they lend to routine failures of the same GOP policies.  That's it.  If there were truly a ""liberal"" media they would never have given Trump the spotlight during his primary and presidential campaigns as they did.  They wanted ratings because ratings mean revenue and revenue likely (obviously) means profits.  They then turn around and wonder how the man got elected when in reality you couldn't turn your head without hearing or reading about him.  When they don't call out bullshit verbatim or even mention lies in headlines it becomes very obvious that they hold their ratings over the well-being of this country. but they do it’s literally all I see on the newsAnd even if your argument held up that still doesn’t mean that trump has control of the mass media. I very clearly wasn't saying that Trump owns our media.  FFS I literally said it is corporate media.  I only chimed in because I was linked I didn't go through your shitty comment chain since I know you won't give a shit what I say anyway.  My argument holds up for my point.  I would say that Trump wants to control the media but he has failed thus far.  His rhetoric is very dangerous though. The argument I was making was that trump doesn’t mass control media. That’s what the argument was here. I don’t know why you came trying to argue something else. I was simply adding legitimate perspective since I was tagged as I already stated. And you think fox news is what? A pie company? I think fox is as shitty as all of the others So if we’re taking about biases are we just going to ignore the insane bias CNN MSNBC and other have towards trump? Or does those not count You still haven’t provided any examples of this “insane bias” you keep talking about.I’m getting the impression that’s your claim is in fact nothing but an alternate reality that you have selected to live in. I’m at work on mobile until 10:30 so I can’t really just research right now.Either way this isn’t something you need a source on it’s very clear the trump does not control mass media. Turn on CNN right now and you will see that.Also the news coming out now that the claims of trump encouraging muller to lie was not true doesn’t really help your claim.Or remember when buzzfeed lied about the Steele dossier? Yeah but trump has control over mass media ah... evidence that is so “obvious” that you don’t even need to back it upI’m done with you. You have an example of that? Articles or videos where they're unfairly blaming him or shaming him? I can’t find the source at the moment - on mobile - but I read that Nixon’s GOP support was near 80% within days of his impeachment. This isn’t really all that new. According to the Moral Foundations Theory they’re a party that espouses loyalty far more than independent thought (this why progressives often can’t get their shit together - infighting over bona fides and degrees of progressivism). McConnell and his crew have to be committed. The GOP could literally be named a RICO organization (not saying it will but saying it will qualify under the law) when this is over so they’re potentially going down with the ship if it goes down. Well that’s when we get to see once and for all a sitting president be indicted. The Atlantic’s recent article is a must read piece for anyone interested in the prospect of impeachment.A point not mentioned - even if it’s doomed to fail on partisan grounds I think house democrats have an obligation to the republic and as a matter of precedent to file articles of impeachment and force the senate to vote against removal from office.That said the new Congress hasn’t been in power for even a month yet. I’ll be patient for a time to allow for House time to use their subpoena power to gather more information and Mueller to continue his investigation. They should all rot in hell. Trump is a fucking disaster and there is no doubt in my mind that he is as guilty as fuck of multiple felonies. I brought up his crimes to someone today (not on reddit) and my response was basically ""but uranium one!"" Blows my fucking mind. Really shows we're never far from repeating German history. Eternal vigilance is the price of freedom to be sure. Republicans are COWARDSIf trump was a democrat he would already have been impeached... I lean right on certain issues would absolutely be in favor of impeaching him if the evidence is there. We just need to be patient and wait for everything to unfold let the evidence be gathered etc. I’ve got some right wing beliefs too but I agree with you it shouldn’t matter wether you agree with the President or not if he committed a crime he should be impeached and convicted. Have they published evidence yet? No but claim that someone has seen evidence. Without hard evidence I find a perjury allegation to be very dubious. Incorrect. Mueller’s team states that some aspects of the reporting is inaccurate. This does not debunk the whole report nor is it the same as saying the report was false.

cheweychewchew,Suborning perjury.  Another impeachable (and imprisonable) offense. I don’t want him imprisoned—at least not right away. I want him stripped naked and marched through the streets for people to spit and throw things at him Game of Thrones-style. Except he can wear a loon cloth because only Ivanka wants to see that.Edit: I don’t know what a loon cloth is but I feel like it’s better for Trump than a loin cloth. I think that the worst thing would be to place him in a general population in a prison somewhere and never speak of him again. Removal of any and all spotlights and attention would be the worst sentence for him. Never speaking of him again would defeat the purpose. Future generations need to be told about this so they know what will happen if they try it again. How Stalin of you Oh it'll be in the history books.  But for him personally putting him in a hole and never speaking to him again would be best. What the hell? I want him in prison. Today. I want his cell to be on camera and live-streamed 24/7.

progress18,Strategically I don’t think it would make sense to start impeachment before the Mueller investigation is completed. Without that you get a whole lot of Fox News and Republican talking points about how “you can’t impeach someone just because you don’t like them”.Waiting for the Mueller investigation to run its course wait a week and then start would help counterpoint that pretty hard. “you can’t impeach someone just because you don’t like them”Unfortunately for them you can. I’m aware that you can. Doesn’t mean it won’t be a talking point.Strategically it’s just smarter to wait for Mueller Report to come out. Yes yes. I'm sure the House could get the articles through but does anyone think that Republicans in the Senate would? There's no way - how many just voted not to sanction the Russian Oligarch just to make Trump happy?If we can't get Republicans to condemn Russian oligarchs or vote to open the government now when they already did in the past unanimously they're not going to lift a finger against Trump.Our government is broken - maybe beyond repair. You wanna know how I could tell you didn’t read the article? No Because the article addresses literally every “concern” you voice before espousing nihilism. I'd argue that the article still glosses over these problems with a too rosy view.Indeed the Senate’s Republican majority has shown little will to break with the president—though that may change. The process of impeachment itself is likely to shift public opinion both by highlighting what’s already known and by bringing new evidence to light. If Trump’s support among Republican voters erodes his support in the Senate may do the same.Emphasis mine and I point it out because of how absurdly entrenched partisan support for Trump has been. Republican party support has rarely if ever fallen below 80% so I don't know if I have confidence that actual impeachment proceedings that begin without real damning evidence will actually get that far.But this sort of vote-counting in any case misunderstands the point of impeachment. The question of whether impeachment is justified should not be confused with the question of whether it is likely to succeed in removing a president from office. The country will benefit greatly regardless of how the Senate ultimately votes.Again I think this paints too optimistic a picture of the process. I don't know if the prevailing opinion will be that if impeachment fails it was worth it to show off the resolve of the constitutional process. Got em Ladies and gentlemen... We need to make an example of him. We let Bush get away with war crimes and this is what we get. Im a conservative why am i here?? I feel like we’re at the point where impeachment would be bad for Dems in 2020 as it would be handing the GOP an opportunity to distance themselves from Trump and run Pence. At this point we should be focused on ousting the GOP from control of the WH and if that fails then consider impeachment most likely after the Muller report. Since we have control of the house there will at least be some checks to Trumps agenda before the 2020 elections so hopefully he can’t destroy any more lives before then He hasn’t done anything technically unconstitutional or anything that meets the qualifications of impeachment. Hey look someone else who hasn’t read the damn article. About midway through it discusses clear violations of the spirit of the path of office being impeachable despite not being violations of the letter of the law.RTFA before posting. Pretty sure he just came to the closest r/liberal article he could find to rustle some feathers. He doesnt actually give a shit about the future of this country i assume. Pretty sure hes done plenty of unconstitutional/illegal shit while in the white house. Youre a coward for not educating himself on how hes lining his fucking pockets with this presidency.

Tell me if thatd make me a jackass. Tell me thatd be a pointless use of my time just like you sitting up in here waiting to fight someone you disagree with. Go cry to your president. I hear he loves standing up for beliefs. And oppression.Side note: your post and comment history consists of 80% r/memes and r/memeeconomy and ill take that into account when discussing anything with you. As if you would have an actual discussion. Since youre a little troll. Maybe have something to say other than bullshit or obvious lies that can be checked before coming to comment? I'm pretty sure articles of impeachment have been brought against every president in my lifetime. Either they are all crooked or it's just a game that pols play. Either way I no longer believe the hype life will go on about the same as it always has. They all do stuff I don't agree with and some I like the next will do the same but different. How old are you two? Cause no articles of impeachment were brought up against Obama and I don't remember any for Bush either. I guess for President Obama it was just many Republicans in office saying they wanted to impeach Mr. Obama. They did infact write articles of impeachment of Presidents Bush and Clinton and Bush Sr. and Reagan. Only Mr. Clinton actually made it to the Senate where he was acquitted. Do we really want Pence though? His positions are actually a lot more extreme than Trump’s and he seems a bit more collected (despite being just as corrupt) so the media wouldn’t be able to run 24/7 news about the latest oval office mouth fart. trump impeachable offenses - and/or Crimes Against Humanity:Emoluments Profiting from the office.Conspired with a foreign nation to swing the election.  trump is the unindited co-consprirator to felony campaign finance violations.Obstructed justice to cover up said conspiracy.Endless failures to carry the duty and dignity of the office.used insecure communication devicesPossible blackmail of several senators and possibly a Supreme Court justice?Instigating RACIST attacks (Advocating Violence and Undermining Equal Protection Under the Law)Abusing the Pardon PowerWitness Tampering and Sharing State Secrets with Foreign Powers Using Presidential Office to illegally attack Private Companies…Human-Caused Climate Change DENIALMoney Laundering tax evasionAccusations of rape and sexual assaultDirecting Law Enforcement to Investigate and Prosecute Political adversaries for improper and unjustifiable PurposesUndermining the Freedom of the PressViolated Campaign Finance LawsCruelly and Unconstitutionally imprisoning Children and their Families in American Concentration Camps - update: children dying in American Concentration CampsImpeach trump https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efforts_to_impeach_Donald_Trump The immediate downside is for lack of any better word the stupidity of the GOP voter base.

BTW take a look at today's NYT article on Kamala Harris. She might be done for unless she runs as Republican. But that is progress even though it should have been sooner in your opinion.The actual ""progress"" has come from actual leftists and socialists who actually know what it means to organize and vote instead of just putting Fight song over a speech and calling it a day.Pelosi and Schumer are still in charge they're incredibly friendly with big corporations receive donations from MNCs who's best interests will lead to irreperable damage to the climate. The middle class is disappearing student loans medical bills and shit jobs are ruining everything and what did the Democrats do in all the years they had control before Trump? Nothing.These mid terms are a good sign I agree but that was because of the actual leftists who made it in.

The first missed paycheck was last week.  Next rent isn't due until February.  Did they miss the January rent before the missed a paycheck? The letter from the Trump administration telling people to offer services in exchange for rent didn't help them? That's unbelievable. If these people are already in a bind maybe their spending habits aren't in line with their pay.,0,False,t3_agmzxl,9,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/agmzxl/some_renters_are_already_facing_eviction_thanks/,38,,Some Renters Are Already Facing Eviction Thanks To The Shutdown,38,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shutdown-low-income-renters-housing-programs-section-8-eviction_us_5c3e1823e4b01c93e00e1a86

Cancer Yet he continues to be president. This country is a shit hole. We need a better way to remove incompetent jerkwads like Britain is attempting with Theresa May right now. I mean he is literally the worst spy Russia ever had. Look at what he's done to the US. I'd call him one of the best. “#Double Agent Donnie” to the Q-tards. Just relax and let it happen. When the investigation concerning Trump is over we can look at the facts make a decisions and act on it accordingly (depending on his level of guilt if any). If he's guilty of treason of course he should be impeached.But the fact remains that so far Russia really hasn't done much with Trump in the White House.They literally invaded another country and conquered new territory during Obama's presidency and not much was down about it. They still hold on to that territory.Just wait for the investigation to end and the report to be released. Are you overlooking the sanctions?  Are you overlooking the Magnitsky Act? Are you suggesting that the USA send troops?The fact is Trump supports the Russian propaganda.  The fact is that Trump promotes the discord that Putin desires in the West. The fact is Trump parrots Putin’s lies. The fact is this gives Russia credibility that it would not otherwise have. Newsflash: You clearly have no idea at all what NATO was created for or why it still exists. Right wing troll. Russian troll. I love how your username is trying too hard lmao We try very hard here some might say the hardest I have people looking into it and they say ""Random douche you are the best trier"" Only the idiotic sheep on the right who believe the far fetched conspiracies that NATO is going to invade & disarm America whilst Obama uses the American military to invade Texas under the guise of Jade Helm. Why would the USA need to invade one of its own states? Well of course it's because everything is bigger and better in Texas including armed rebellion!That darned Obama! What with his Race War his invasion of traditionally conservative areas with Liberal Lesbian Farmers to change how states vote his disarming of American Patriots aka Pretend Army Guys and turning over American Sovereignty to foreign nations --like Russia-- and making straight white males date and fuck transsexuals. I tells ya that guy sure ruined America!Oh wait. None of that happened?!? I suppose there was just something about that guy that made it possible for White Conservative Christians to distrust him more than any other POTUS even truly believing he was a Super Duper Double Secret Muslim Nazi Communist Satan Worshipper. I just can't quite place my finger on it but I'm sure it'll come to me eventually. Just something about him that enrages the White Conservative Christians. Hmmm...something. Ghaahhh! So frustrating not being able to figure it out! You’ve got quite the enemy built up in your mind. There are a lot of us who are sick of underwriting European corruption. Frankly a lot of our old allies are parasitic and have been for awhile. I’d like to see us leave NATO and just work with the Five Eye countries and maybe the Dutch. All of them are good productive humanitarian minded nations these days and we have really positive relations with them. Anyway you probably think I’m a soviet and I suspect your on the EU payroll but just my two cents lolAlso the secret muslim nazi commie stuff is ridiculous. I’m old they said the same things about Clinton and the left’s equivalent crazies say the same racist/hitler/dictator stuff about Trump that they said about Bush. It’s pathetic and low rhetoric that we should wash our hands of. Have a good day :) If you have genuine issues with policies actions budgets or even just believe an organization is outdated I'm certainly open to finding solutions that work for all sides. But surely you understand that you are part of a quite small minority within the Trump camp right? Because you are. Most of them don't even know what NATO is or why it exists. They just gnash their teeth rage when prompted and repeat the predictable propaganda in every discussion or debate they happen to wander into. That’s not what the Trump supporters wanting out of NATO are thinking. We think America should be less of the world police force in general and spend much of that money here.

TeJay42,speaking for myself I think the wiki page on the alt-right is pretty accurate. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-rightThis is a solid description. Alt-rightism is an authoritarian white nationalist (some supremacists) ideology. There’s also an “alt-lite” who are more libertarian-ish nationalists but don’t care about race but care a LOT about western culture perhaps more so than alt-righters. The alt-right stopped caring about Trump once he got elected but the alt-lite are definitely pro Trump people. I think it's intentionally nebulous.I think there's a huge amount of misinformation that's spread by the far right about their ideas and motivations.When you know the other side is dishonestintentionally it's almost impossible to label them with any real accuracy.Perhaps that dishonesty is the main giveaway. Well you see thats the issue here. You used far fight to describe the alt right. I should've clarified but that's also thrown around Willy nilly and to be honest it's not clear what ideas and beliefs fall under that. I do believe the alt right and what most would consider the far right are nearly the same.I mean some people might consider libertarians to be far right and I wouldn't include them. But the far right of the gop yes. Well what would you consider alt right or far right then? What ideas and beliefs would these people subscribe to? It's hard but I think racist and nationalist ideas are often present. I think they often focus on ideas like mens rights and attacking liberal civil rights ideas. They are often quite extreme on economic issue like taxation regulations and welfare.,0,False,t3_agobok,10,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/agobok/what_do_you_guys_consider_to_be_the_alt_right/,10,"A short bit about me for transparency.

progress18,Key portion of ruling:  Ross and Trump did this on purpose and violated the law in multiple different ways to get what they wanted.Second the Court concludes on the merits that Secretary Ross violated the APA in multiple independent ways.  Most blatantly Secretary Ross ignored and violated a statute that requires him in circumstances like those here to collect data through the acquisition and use of “administrative records” instead of through “direct inquiries” on a survey such as the census.  Additionally Secretary Ross’s decision to add a citizenship question was “arbitrary and capricious” on its own terms: He failed to consider several important aspects of the problem; alternately ignored cherry-picked or badly misconstrued the evidence in the record before him; acted irrationally both in light of that evidence and his own stated decisional criteria; and failed to justify significant departures from past policies and practices — a veritable smorgasbord of classic clear-cut APA violations.  On top of that Secretary Ross acted without observing procedures required by law including a statute requiring that he notify Congress of the subjects planned for any census at least three years in advance.  And finally the evidence establishes that Secretary Ross’s stated rationale to promote VRA enforcement was pretextual — in other words that he announced his decision in a manner that concealed its true basis rather than explaining it as the APA required him to do.  Notably the Court reaches all of those conclusions based exclusively on the materials in the official “Administrative Record” — that is the record of materials collected and submitted by Defendants that Secretary Ross allegedly considered directly or indirectly prior to making his decision.  Looking beyond the Administrative Record merely confirms the Court’s conclusions and illustrates how egregious the APA violations were.,0,False,t3_ag9aa5,1,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/ag9aa5/trump_citizenship_question_on_2020_census_blocked/,36,,Trump Citizenship Question on 2020 Census Blocked by Court; A federal judge blocked the Trump Administration’s plan to put a question about citizenship on the 2020 census which will help determine U.S. elections congressional seats and federal funding decisions for a decade.,36,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-15/u-s-court-blocks-citizenship-question-on-2020-census

jonfla,"Serious question.... Why TF wasn't the funds approved when Republicans held the house in 17 and 18????? Why now is this shit show of reality whining about it now? Why is it the democrats fault? I can’t believe they try to trick us into believing  it’s the Dems fault... Its totally not the 200+ Republicans and their one cult leader making these decisions that are completely fucking over millions of Americans. All this simply because they’re too stupid and ignorant to try and understand the place they’re putting their people in by contributing a useless government shutdown.Makes total sense to have some of the government employees still getting payed decide if a ton of them should go without pay! Because they're extremely bad at their jobs. My theory is diversions.... Yet another one right now so we don't see how they are fucking us over even more than whats in clear sight. Division as well as diversion. Push each side further apart by drumming up chaos and drama. When we the people don’t stand together anymore it’s much easier for those in power to do what they want and get away with it. We should be looking for compromises and middle grounds instead of turning our democratic process into a game of red vs blue. I do still have faith our ability to see through the BS and start working together to build a place we’re all happy to call home. However I also realize that the people I have interacted with the last few years who I base that faith on is only a small portion of the demographic and we very well could be beyond the point of no return. That timeline is depressing though so I choose to believe the former. Damn autocorrect got me but yes that's what I was meeting and I completely agree!! The things that the shutdown is harming are things they can't harm themselves with laws. The food safety that liberals love is a massive wasted expense. But if they got rid of it they would look like villains. Like when we couldn't buy lettuce when they changed the laws for produce washing. HUD which republicans all know is a waste is gonna dump thousands onto the streets when they don't get renewals. Climate reports based on government findings are going to be delayed because they couldn't make the meetings. So that will be another thing climate deniers can point at and say look no information must be fake. People that waited for court dates for years now have to wait even more years to become citizens.  There's dozens of things this shutdown is doing that harm the most vulnerable of us that the rich have wet dreams over.This isn't about a wall. If it was like you say they would have built it. This is about hitting the poor elderly disabled with their own hands and saying stop hitting yourself. This is their way of showing their superpacs and think tanks that they are working for them. It's Steve king saying ""what's so bad about white supremacy?"" while showing the world what it looks like.They could have built the wall anytime in the last 2 years. They didn't because the know it's not needed. The idea of building it is a more powerful tool. Sure they want their Mexican Rushmore with swastikas and tiki torches. They just don't want it bad enough to do only that. The goal is to hurt as many as they can with the smallest effort. They found when they shutdown to stop healthcare they could hurt so many by doing nothing. Political theater.  This is trump trying to impress his ""base"" while at the same time trying to cast dispersion on the democrats.  Nothing more.It'll end when Laura Ingraham Hannity etc... have decided that they can spin this as a victory for trump.  Maybe when the first kid dies because of salmonella that the FDA should have been testing for maybe when businesses can't fly anymore because there are no TSA agents left but the right-wing media machine is just looking for the opportunity to get trump out of this - probably by spinning it as ""he had to be the bigger man and capitulate because of <some right wing concern here>"" Agreed trump was right about running the government like he ran his businesses.  sociopathic shut down and his employees aren’t getting paid.“Mexico will pay for the wall.”“Americans will pay for the wall or I will shut the government down.” 2020 will be here before we know it.If we don't let this child's temper tantrum extinguish itself then that flame will probably go on to burn forever.Or at least until the the arteries clog from all the greasy food.

So then let's look at the silver lining.We have very strong data and evidence to support what NOT to do and what does NOT work.2020 is largely looking to favor (I hope) a saner time. And in turn we need to take every day between the election in 2020 and the one in 2024 to prevent this nonsense from ever occurring again in the United States of (for now)America. Personally I would love to see Citizens United go away along with the Electoral College. Like he cares.  Most Americans voted against him and despise him.If only we would stand up for our right to self-government. We have a government “by the people” right now but we fucked it up over the last 50 years by electing people with zero ethical sense.Looking for someone to blame? Look in the mirror. Also look in your parents and grandparents mirror. It comes down to this: We are an avoidant people.That is both our strength and weakness.Why would we ignore the messages of totalitarian tyrants in the early 20th century?  Because we could just move to California and chill instead.But now what? YupThe 40% that supports trump is all he cares aboutuntil planes stop flying to vegas and trump and co. get an angry call from Sheldon Adelson I dont expect the Trump ShutDown to end by his own admission in previous years and even weeks interviews he holds himself responsible.except now that its a reality its entirely not his fault at all.. smh He stated “The Democrat’s can end this in 15 minutes” Well you started it you said you were proud to shut down the government and you would own it so it figures you started it owned it proud of it so end it in. He literally said on national television; in a meeting with Democratic party leadership; that he would ""be proud"" to take responsibility for a shutdown and he ""won't blame democrats"".How many demonstrable lies does one orange autocrat have to tell before his sycophantic cult followers realize he can't be trusted? Its like the classic tootsie roll pop commercial except the owl just licks the damn thing for years with an anatomically correct bird tongue Here is a thought:What if we just go ahead and build the wall?

throwa2934,"The fact he has been repeatedly elected over and over by Republicans tells you a little something about how OK they are with racists representing them. Makes you curious about Devin Nunes' family quietly moving the farm from California to Iowa and specifically to King's district and set up a new dairy farm. I read an article in which many of the other dairy farmers in the district said obliquely that due to low unemployment in the area they couldn't run their farms without illegal immigrants. Nunes' family refused to be interviewed. Nunes is a stooge for Trump yet his extended family appears to employ the ""dangerous invaders"" that Trump rails against. Someone should ask King about this. My running hypothesis with conservatives is that whatever they rail against (illegals entering the country from Mexico gay marriage abortion trans issues etc) they're doing it in secret.  Employing illegals toe tapping in airport bathrooms getting secret abortions for their daughter when THEY get knocked up watching trans porn on their phones etc. This is bigly true for Iowa. They depend on migrant and undocumented labor. It's not just on farms but in meat rendering plants. Big scandal a few years back with undocumented minors caught working in a kosher meatpacking plant.Iowa for some reason has decided to be the land of shitty ag regulation as well. The same bad apple who caused salmonella outbreaks in the 70s in Maryland went to Maine and when Maine belatedly got fed up with him he went to Iowa (chicken farmer) and buddied up with Grassley. Btw fuck that guy too. I'm from his stretch of Iowa and I assure you his constituents don't care I think you misspelled ""love him because he's racist"". Andrew Gillum said it perfectly. Doubt it I'd love for him to be held accountable or voted out but it just won't likely happen Steve King has been called out for 15 years now. If these folks could feel any shame voting for this guy wouldn't it have kicked in by now? I agree with Jeb: a primary challenge to unseat this piece of crap is the best solution. He shouldn't have a voice in Congress: when he speaks it's to the worst of our humanity. He literally had all his corporate sponsors abandon him and fund his opponent. Every other Iowa Republican that ran for Congress lost except. That tells you how popular his support is. Not to mention how fucking stupid this man is.  Watch him struggle through interviews.  He's brainless and racist a GOP posterboy. Kick his ass out Sorry I'll believe it's catching up with him when he actually faces consequences and loses his seat. As it stands it sounds like all that's catching up to him is some mild rebuke and the GOP hoping he'll be a little quieter and hold his seat for them. With all due respect to Mother Jones I'll believe Steve King's racism is catching up with him when he's expelled from the House of Representatives or failing that at least primaried out of his seat. Until then this is just a handful of Republicans doing some asscovering by pretending to care. Republicans who still support a racist president support his racist philosophy sitting idly by while trump appoints racists to government positions and republicans who allow trump to make racist laws tweet racist comments make racist comments at his 'campaign rallies' and during his ‘presidency’ and build CONCENTRATION CAMPS - then people who give that tacit support to trump are racist… In other words people who STILL support trump; are RACIST by default. https://www.alternet.org/right-wing/united-states-witnessing-shocking-rise-alt-right-violenceGun-nuts ready to start killing Americans they don't agree with: https://www.rawstory.com/2016/06/right-wing-gun-nut-warns-conservatives-will-use-bullet-box-if-they-cant-win-at-ballot-box/ At this point it is not just the racism.

progress18,"Okay.......now we arrest his dumbass right? I mean how many fucking reasons do we need? I guess due process and all that but C'MON ALREADY!! We can’t simply because the movements for impeachment require 2/3rds majority in the house AND the senate and the senate is an undemocratic institution controlled by republicans who will never vote to impeach no matter how much evidence there is. Not to mention this is a case that will 100% go to the supreme court and will fail because trump has 2 appointees on the supreme court who want to keep their jobs. The senate is a democratic institution they are elected officials.The GOP will vote to impeach as soon as it is politically expedient to do so. That's how politics works.The president cannot fire a supreme court justice.There is no legal precedent for indicting a sitting president. If the evidence is clear enough legal scholars tend to think it is possible. We will find out.You need to calm down. The system is slow and ugly but its gotten us through worse than this. There are allot of good people working to hold Trump accountable. Give them a chance. I’ve always felt the system we have was designed as a perfect balance to get shit done while still mitigating hysteria. It's being tested this administration is using misinformation and controversy to great effect. All we really can do is stay engaged and trust the judicial system I know I need to simmer down but sometimes I have a moment of ""holy shit the president is corrupt as fuck!"" clarity and I freak out for a minute. Thanks for the info! They’re elected based on geographic area not population. It’s undemocratic I think you are talking about the electoral college and I would agree. However congressional districts are based on population. Gerrymandering is a huge issue but the system is democratic otherwise. Nope the senate. Every state has 2 senators which grants rediculously more political power to voters in less populous states. How is it democratic for california which makes up 12 percent of the US population and wyoming which has .12 percent of the population to have the same amount of political power? Actually yes! I completely forgot about the two seat thing. The electoral college is far more egregious but I see what you are saying.The senate was designed to protect small states from their powerful neighbors. It's a bit antiquated but I think it works in theory. The senate is just too powerful nowadays The issue lies in that the senate has equal power to the house of representatives which is actually based on population and represents the democratic will of the people. If the senate had severely lesser power and didn’t have a veto vote on every piece of national legislation and simply existed to provide advisory votes on the needs of individual states it would make way more sense. I agree. Term limits too. These career senators that keep getting reelected simply because they have been there for decades and therefore chair some important committee or another they are some of the most jaded; corrupt bigots in government For sure.

progress18,"Of the many changes that need to be made the leader of the Senate will have to have much less power to block legislation. That's not representative govt. at all when some hick from freakin Kentucky can hamstring the whole govt. Is the power of the Speaker just tradition or is it actually enshrined in law? What would it take to change this? Tradition. Lyndon B. Johnson implemented the “tradition” in a power grab. He convinced his colleagues this was best because he could reduce their workload and increase efficiency. It’s been a part of the senate ever since.Edit: Source: Robert Caro’s third biography of LBJ titled Master of the Senate. So there are no written rules granting this power? Not to my knowledge. I’ll double check.Edit: this “policy” is actual a precedent that was first established in 1937:Later in 1937 Vice President John Nance Garner a former Speaker of the House who valued leadership prerogatives announced a new policy. Under the Senate rule requiring the presiding officer to ""recognize the Senator who shall first address him"" Garner established the precedent of giving priority recognition to the majority leader and then to the minority leader before all other senators seeking to speak. These two 1937 developments–priority recognition and front-row seating–contributed greatly to the evolution of modern Senate floor leadership.Source. Wikipedia has further information on the standing rules of the senate.These standing rules get their power from laws. They do not cover all the powers of the senate majority leader many of which are based on precedent. Regardless these precedents like the standing rules would (presumably) require the will of a majority of senators to change them.As I see it the two parties seek to maintain their power and will not let this happen for fear of a third party taking advantage.

progress18,Gee if the average citizen fails to pay the water bill gas and electric bill it would be turned off immediately. So why not do the same to the White House? That would imply they are not above the law I don’t think paying for water and electricity is the law. I think it’s more of a contract of service And contracts are protected by laws and legal obligations. The water company is basically saying that they think the white house has good enough credit to pay its dues eventually... So they clearly haven't looked too closely at the chief inhabitant's history. They’re legally enforceable but not the law due to being able to opt out. if the average citizen fails to pay the water bill gas and electric bill it would be turned off immediately.That isn't accurate.  Most states have laws about turning off peoples heat in winter. Yeah but they’ll still turn it off in the summer.  You got what they meant. If people are paying attention if not better believe people get their power shut off in the winter because they don't know that it's illegal. No problem.  Trump could do chores for extra cash or maybe drive for Uber or sell off some stuff. A White House garage sale is bound to make some money! All this old stuff just laying around! Don't give him ideas selling off a Smithsonian to Saudis could probably raise 5 billion. Shut it down NO GOVERNMENT NO WATER The millions is for the all Federal Buildings affected by the shutdown. Should we shut them all off? Yes. I wonder who is actually responsible for paying these bills. You.   Taxpayers. Obviously that’s where the money comes from I mean I wonder whose job it is to make sure the money gets to the utility office. Why is that even under the purview of the President's staff?  Why wouldn't the admin of the building itself be a completely non-government office? Because the White House like all buildings owned by the government is the government’s responsibility? That's my point though.  It should just be something that's handled administratively not the President's staff. It’s not handled by White House staff.

therecordcorrected,"Are they actually outraged though? No and the initial study was published like 3-4 years ago. The better post would be if OP just wrote about “toxic masculinity is probably why people become conservate blah blah blah” imo. Honestly there is not too much wrong with masculinity or femininity it just shouldnt dictate your political views Maybe not but sometimes is seems as though peoples masculinity or femininity is the thing being directly attacked by the politicians. In that case it seems reasonable that someone might be voting in self defense. Wait idk what we’re talking about here? What comes to mind to me is like these ""bathroom bills"". You get a kid that is born male but everything in this kids being is calling out female. The kid knows this owns it and proceeds to live as normal a life as possible. Part of that normality for this kid can be as simple as using the rest room. On one side we've got politicians introducing actual laws telling these kids what the feel and know is wrong and they'll be damned if they let them proceed to live the life they know to be true. On the other side we've got politicians not introducing laws against these kids but actively working to oppose the laws written by the ""other guys"".Now you tell me. As these kids go through life and reach voting age are they supposed to ignore everything that just happened to them less they be accused of letting something like the above dictate their political views? I know at least one conservative on my fb timeline who shared the article and made some tirade about shooting guns drinking beer and bourbon  and eating meat.  It was exactly as dignified as one would expect. Ya I was gunna ask same question. I dont know anyone who would be outraged by made up terminology like toxic masculinity. All terminology is made up. Where do you think it comes from? I think he's implying ""toxic masculinity doesnt exist"". He's wrong and said it weirdly. It's jarring to be told you're responsible for your own terrible behavior and that you're not actually practicing ""tough love"" you're just abusing your children. This article is pretty slim on the question of what toxic masculinity is?There are some vague claims about self-reliance leading to men not seeking help for mental health issues. Is self-reliance meant to be an indicator of toxic masculinity?Unfortunately males are going to be overrepresented in violent crime because the most aggressive humans are usually male... this IS a biological determined feature of humanity.Now I am not saying ALL males are more aggressive than ALL females. That is a dumb thing to say. It is not true that ALL males are stronger than ALL females but in a similar fashion to the fact that the fastest human is going to be Male so the most violent will be. This because the hormones governing physical development also govern psychological development.So even though Men and women are very similar by in large the small differences result in at the extremes (think sport) a stacking of one sex versus the other. The fastest female would destroy almost all males in a race but a female will never be the fastest human because of how the small differences stack at the extremes. Replace fastest with most aggressive and the effect will be the same. Is self-reliance meant to be an indicator of toxic masculinity?Let me share a story about this to highlight how this works.My dad isn't the handiest man out there. My stepmom's brother is generally better at fixing things than him. So whenever a project happens around the house my stepmom will ask my father to do it he'll agree then not do it for a long time. Stepmom's brother is then called to do it and my dad will then get pissy for a good long while because ""we don't need him coming in here and doing things"".So yeah self reliance is a good thing until it makes you incapable of taking help. Being able to do stuff on your own is a virtue not being able to ask for help when you need it will only harm you.TLDR: moderation is key and toxic comes into play when things hit an extreme. Macho behavior is killing planet Earth.The whole 'man dominates the planet' is BS.  Earth bats last... I don't dispute that machismo is negative in most applications but we can't still be fooled into thinking domination of domain is the responsible ideology anymore.  No that's a guise to make explanation so easy that it's dismissable.The destruction of our environment now takes billions of dollars skilled political maneuvering precision in engineering mechanical and cartographic disciplines and the ability to convince otherwise rational people to act in self or small group best interest.That's far short of being some big bad conspiracy theory cartel but it's also far removed from ""Grunt is man.  Grunt own planet."" I meant it was one piece of the puzzle - a very important piece.The solution - respect scientific findings not Human-Caused Climate Change DENIAL.Change the way people think change the world. Just think if our ancestors weren't obsessed with concurring and destruction in the name of these notions that if you   fail to destroy you will be destroyed.  We might not need to spend such a triumphant effort to save our lives from ourselves.Perhaps you are right.It could be used as a tool instead. Kinda taking the low road but instead of changing these toxic thought patterns so late in the game.  Using the competitive nature that fuels this destruction to fuel a sweeping change needed to stop the human apocalypse.The high road being to change the parts of us that need to destroy to feel superior.  If the models are at all accurate we don't have time for that. Good points.I still hold out hope that humans will evolve... Technically yeah. Whatever traces we leave will be our evolution. This comment is more likely to survive the future we face than any offspring I might have. Even if we make the Paris accord due dates there's going to be massive deaths. Odds of passing genetic codes tomorrow are significantly lower than they are today. More good points.thanks I had to check and remind myself which sub I was in before responding to make sure I wasn't way off on my own here but...I think a day of change is coming.  We're quickly working smarter and hard work is admired... except when it's the time wasting sympathy builder it's commonly used as these days.  We used to think hard work was physical... now thats just the bad way to go about it.  Have to dig a hole? Get a backhoe.  Hell one surface mining client of mine has an entire automated strip mining location.  I don't condone that type of mining but they prove my point.  A ""hard day"" is more likely to be mental than physical anymoreFast forward and the day of understanding we don't need the work of everyone for maintaining day to day life will drive Healthcare and energy and even income reform.  People will be free and encouraged to follow their passions for economic possibility instead of diligently clocking in.  Even first response services where we say ""Humans are always needed 24/7!"" is only partly true.  Do you know how many of those jobs could actually be retired with new technologically achievable systems that could save and preserve life?We've got a lot of changing to do and if progressives like me can't get liberals on board to stop fighting conservatives and just find ways to move on without them... Well nevermind that's what always happens.  Conservatives only ever seem to be conserving the last thing they ever remember being mildly inconvenienced by and blaming it on progress rather than the measured adoption required because of conservative nonsense. I'm not sure if you're aware of this but there is a massive right-wing politico-religious movement in the United States known as Dominionism that literally believes their specific brand of fundamentalist Christianity has a divine mandate to subdue the earth and rule over every living thing on it.  And this movement explicitly opposes both environmentalism and climate science. I am aware of Dominionism but I think you have a different definition of the word ""massive"" than any dictionary ever.They are very fringe and relatively low in number despite their literal desire to bring on the ""end of days"" as fast as possible.

texlorax,"For a long time I’ve been saying that the one unifying idea of republicans and conservatives is pissing off liberals. I Trump they think they’ve found their golden boy. By staying calm we deprive them of the joy they get from pissing us off. I’m genuinely curious about this. Has this been a thing that’s gone on for a long time or is this mentality relatively new? I’ve only been paying attention to politics since bush jr. and I’m not a historian but I don’t remember this type  of mentality being prevalent until trump. Very long. Read up on the vehement opposition by the right to the following:1935 Social Security Act1935 Unemployment Insurance1964 Head Start1964 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Act (SNAP)1965 Medicare/Medicaid1972 Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI)1972.m Women Infants and Children Program (WIC)1972 Federal Pell Grant ProgramThe Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)1996 Temporary Assistance for Needy Children (TANF)1997 Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)2010 The Affordable Care Act (ACA)Republicans have been trying since The New Deal to hobble cut limit and out right end these programs in order to pay for tax cuts to the very rich while still trying to look fiscally responsible. Now even that charade has been dead since 2000 and are giving themselves tax cuts without cuts to these programs to pay for them. Because they will pay for themselves of course. I swear the whole party is full of angry white men with malignant narcissism who hate women and minorites and their children (who are the primary recipients of these programs.) Don't forget about the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Here in Alabama that one is the key to all the others.  The people here hate the others largely because they don't want hard-working white money going toward taxes for programs that benefit lazy black people. Good point. You are so right. My bad. I agree with everything you wrote but...I'm getting tired of the ""angry white men"" trope.  All of these angry white men are married to angry (probably) white women who are just like them.  Yeah they're the ones in office but if you've ever met/talked to couples like this they're both as bad. That's a good point. Thank you for the very informative post. Will try an make it through these later on.And agreed on your opinions. Eh I do believe that at one point conservatives genuinely cared about fiscal discipline and believed in looser regulations and lower taxes as an economic benefit.  But when Neocons got their way and thought Reganomics would finally be proven and instead it totally blew up in their faces they decided to not reevaluate their policy positions just how they justified them.Notice they no longer give any reasoning at all for lower taxes smaller government fiscal responsibility etc.  They might have even forgotten why they adopted these policies in the first place since they've been proven wrong anyway why bother?No today these policies are pushed for emotional reasons. Liberals like taxes so taxes are bad.  Liberals like social programs so they are bad.  Liberals hate guns so guns are amazing.  Liberals tolerate immigrants gays women and trans people so those are all varying degrees of bad etc. etc. etc....They don't bother to sell their ideas anymore.  They just line their pockets and use emotional manipulation of the dumbest people in the country to push it though.Sadly it's working really well. The republican syndicate regards the rest of society as its preferred slave labor.  They want us to die young and leave lots of little wage slaves behind us.  Their american dream is leaving lots of their own little princes and prinesses behind to rule. Cutting taxes for the 1% and cutting programs that provide a safety net to the poor or disadvantaged (75% of these programs are used by women and their children) does not make the united states an oligarchy. It makes it an asshole. How can you be so inept as to confuse oligarchy with plutocracy. I'd like to introduce you to a small item in our discretionary spending budget. It's called military spending and could be cut quite a bit before it impacted the military in any noticeable way. In fact you could double what those programs need and still not affect the military or even stop bombing children in Syria to do it! As a Conservative that should be very exciting for you! Unfortunately you're a little off on the math. With regard to discretionary spending the military eats up 54% plus another 6% for veterans benefits. SS and Medicare together make up 6%.And I don't know if I'd say Trump ""pulled troops out"" of Syria as much as he said (tweet) he ""pulled troops out"" of Syria. I mean the Whitehouse says there's a plan but this Whitehouse says a lot of shit so... who knows with these guys.Regardless like I said we could cut 20% out of the military budget and not effect it while having a huge impact on helping American citizens. Don't you want to help American citizens? You looked at the discretionary spending not mandatory spending the discretionary doesn't give an accurate perspective on spending and we did pull troops whether you want to acknowledge it or not the president says he defeated isis and whether that's accurate or not doesn't matter too much because that's why we're pulling out if you have even majority senate Republicans voting in favor of leaving Syria then you know that we're leaving. The reason we pay so much for military is because we decided to be the world's police because nobody wants to pay for their own military anymore since you left that fallacy in that last sentence I'll give you another ridiculous question do you hate NATO? Do you want us to just stop supporting South Korea? Discretionary spending where military spending is is how to look at military spending. This is spending that is amazingly enough discretionary.The problem with looking at mandatory spending as a place to cut spending is that mandatory spending is well mandatory.I'm super glad we defeated ISIS though and that they are no longer in existence. According to the same guy that says we defeated ISIS we don't have to be the worlds police anymore. According to that logic we should be able to cut military spending by 75%. For that we should very soon be seeing no out of pocket healthcare no out of pocket costs for education and a reduction of taxes! Add that to ending the drug war and we could see our total cost dropping to the tune of 5% total income tax?When one of those things happens I'll believe ISIS is defeated. Until then... naw..... Wow this man above you is ignorant. Great replies. Why do you lie? You know these numbers are easily researched don’t you? Why just make shit up? You’re here trying to argue that conservatives aren’t what we make them out to be then you start just straight up lying? What kind of end game is that? You’re wrong on all accounts. Try using actually data next time and get away from the bullshit alt-right trash that gave you those bullshit numbers. I remember seeing an interview with some conservative asshat back in 2008 who said he liked Palin because ""she pisses off just the right people for me.""  This kind of childishness has defined the GOP for a long time now and since Trumpism it's just been much more overt.  They care more about ""owning the libs"" than they do about sound governance economic stability or responsible foreign policy.  It's not as if they can legitimately claim they really believed that sleazy gambling promotor (who actually managed to go bankrupt running a casino) a sleazy wrestling promoter or a sleazy pageant operator who was also a Queens slum lord would be good at running a government or managing the world's largest economy or being diplomatic. I used to know a guy back in 2009 who went on and on about how Obama was a ""secret Muslim"" and literally ""the worst person in the world to say nothing of his job as president"" (in 2009 mind you) but would then turn around and (in the same conversation) decry how poorly Palin was treated by the media ""just because she's a woman and liberals hate women"".You can't make this shit up. This dude was a successful relatively wealthy member of society (and actually self-made at that) and his brain allowed such a ridiculously blatant contradiction with no visible discomfort whatsoever. It’s been since Bush Jr at least. Around 2000 was when I started paying attention too. It has been trending though and becoming a bigger and bigger thing with them. I think it's been more since the emerging popularity of Rush Limbaugh and then Fox News. I thought Fox was bad there is a new channel called OANN Our America News Network..  it makes Fox News look balanced and diverse. I want to say it's a reaction to political correctness culture. Or at the very least starts that way. But as with everything there are probably so many different factors. And I have to agree back during the W years it seemed like the inverse. political correctness cultureWhich in itself is basically a straw man invented by the right wing media. Cant agree more. But the Trump base does get riled up by it. This.  Governance via straw man fake crises and meme. I feel like there’s no way trump would have made it this far if it wasn’t for Obama. The bs that surrounded his presidency with the birth certificate his ethnicity and all the other frivolous things that bred on the sidelines really set the stage for hate to make a comeback. Yeah I can't agree more. He had to get his name out there on something.  It is also is the first time I remember him ever making outlandish claims that will get people in an uproar. Don't get me wrong I am sure he has always been controversial. I just don't remember him making outlandish claims. And his base loves it. I have said from the beginning that Republicans would make everyone pay for voting for a black man for president. Trump is their revenge. Which indicates in my mind that the Russians have been working on this operation for a long long time.  It's too bad there are so many weak-minded republicans in this country.",0,False,t3_ae73qd,63,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/ae73qd/hes_not_hurting_the_people_he_needs_to_be_a_trump/,505,,“He’s Not Hurting The People He Needs To Be.” A Trump Voter Says The Quiet Part Out Loud.,505,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/8/18173678/trump-shutdown-voter-florida

zelda-go-go,"In my life I’ve long seen “liberal” used as an insult much like “communist”. Portrayed as dangerous and radical. With the juxtaposition against what is currently conservative being liberal probably seems a safer and more rational. Liberal democrats cannot possibly weaken the military more than conservatives run bigger deficits destroy more jobs and ruin more families than conservatives. You didn't touch on how it's been used as an insult when it was never a bad thing. It's always been more rational.  It's always been the exact same thing as what Republicans are currently doing to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It's always been bad only because Republicans say it is in the same way so many people hate Hillary Clinton but can't pinpoint why.Your comment makes it seem like being ""liberal"" has changed. It has only become more widely accepted. Yes that’s what I meant completely. There’s a psychology principle called the availability heuristic. . If you repeat any random bullshit like “Iraq has wmd” over and over again people will say when asked if Iraq has wmd “oh yeah I thinks that’s true. I’ve heard that before.” Repeating over and over that liberalism is bad fits there. Now people are saying “crazy people can’t really tell me what is crazy and I seriously would love to have a government that isnt shut down over invented bullshit and want Healthcare because living is better than dying.” It’s more accepted. The biggest myth of all time is that dem's run up the deficit. The GOP destroys the debt/GDP ratio everytime it lies cheats and bribes its way into power. How have conservatives weakened the military when they always push to expand the Defense budget? Destroying alliances (this is why Mattis left) praising and defending and covering for murderous dictators ignoring Russian influence in US and other peaceful democracies elevating Kim Jung Un by saluting his military and meeting with him with no deal made. It’s a lot more expensive to protect the country when its alone. Letting Canada have a few extra cents for their milk and lumber industries creates a lot of good will that saves a lot of money in other areas like counter intelligence and information sharing. Calling Cananda and the EU an enemy weakens our alliances. Trump revealed a covert Israeli operation where an Israeli had infiltrated ISIS to the fucking Russian foreign minister and proudly told the world he can do that if he wants to.  The imbedded asset had to be warned the he was compromised. This means internal intelligence agencies will tell Trump only the minimum they feel he needs to know and other countries aren’t telling the US either. The military also devised a plan to save $125bil of just waste without hurting military readiness but it was buried. Can I counter ask you how has raising the defense budget in itself in the face of all this other shit supposed to strengthen the military? And how does throwing more money at a problem fix it in any intelligent way? I'm a liberal and agree that Trump has weakened America on the viewpoint of the world. I was just looking for specific examples of how Trump weakened the military because I have conservative friends who vote Republican primarily because of the military so I was looking for some good talking points.I'm a proponent of reducing the defense budget. Like you said throwing money is not solving the problem. I’ve seen some of your posts. I’m not busting you bro. Maybe counter ask them those questions. Never trumper conservatives I can talk to with no problem good people. I don’t get into it with Trump supporters. He could give Putin a hand job on live tv (again) and they’d love him. Just not trying to get downvoted for asking a clarifying question. Funny I get down voted sometimes for totally valid questions and even got banned from r/Republican and I didn’t even break their terms. I don’t think I care too much if I get down voted as long as I can still post in the subs I follow. Here I’ll upvote you This may have something to do with the fact that ""liberal"" now means moderate to center-left. *PROGRESSIVE ? How could most Dems not emerge liberals after Trump and the Republicans displayed such senseless behavior. Thanks to Trump the GOPS real endgame was revealed: we want it all. We will do anything to get it. Including commit treason. We don’t give a fuck about the Constitution. We don’t need to pretend anymore which was a supreme error. So yeah Democrats now know that they were alone sacrificing for their country. And they might discover that it is quite liberating to be a liberal. Instead of conservatives? Blue Dogs and Dixiecrats would be arguably ""conservative democrats.""Many democrats could identify as moderate as well. I think they’re saying instead of Democrat. A lot of young folk line up to the left of the DNC and there’s been a lot of vitriol thrown at people like Bernie Sanders for not identifying as a Democrat.People see that and are thinking “Well what’s more important? My values or the D after my name?” “These are radical islamic terrorists and she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He won't use the term ‘radical Islamic terrorism’” trump said during the Oct. 9 debateHey trump; Can you say Radical Right-Wing Terrorists? Aren't Democrats supposed to be at least liberal? Exactly. If anything being just liberal puts you to the right side of the Democratic Party. That’s about the most misinformed thing I’ve seen today.

Back in the pre-trump days whenever I would  read some world history I was often struck by what I then considered to be over reactions of the masses.  For instance the French Revolution. ""Good Lord!""I was wont to exclaim.   ""Those French rather went overboard whacking the heads off their formal rulers in such a decisive and rude manner!""Now I understand. Jesus man Trump is nowhere near as bad as most medieval rulers.Anyone who even doubts that for a second doesn't have a clue about history No he's just a farce of every American stereotype that exists the result of a propagandized base and an apathetic opposition.

I read that there was $100million on the table with Maine opting out of the Medicaid expansion. Did you guys just use that $100million on the table to do this expansion? If so this would mean you guys are using your state tax dollars to fund this correct?  If not how's it being paid for? If so why this program over other tax funded projects? At the expense of your money! Worth it so people don't die....tell me are you  a christian? We're Republicans in Maine able to opt out of such a socialist program or did they happily take the free healthcare? Do it do it do it! You know this is a liberal sub right? The clue is in the name. Crazy that republicans will benefit from this too right? It’s almost like we are all human and we all need things like healthcare? It’s incredible that your such a piece of trash that you would refuse medical care to Americans because they disagree with you. This right here. This is why people think Republicans are idiots. Because this is the most idiotic thing I’ve read all day. And hard-working immigrants. Right and left people both make about the same there are a lot of poor and wealthy in both parties.  Rural areas tend to be red and cities are always blue.  Cities generate the wealth in this country which in turn finances the general welfare of rural areas which is why red states with a lot of rural areas tend to be a drag on the federal budget while blue states with large cities create the surplus.  You really can't get around the fact that people in cities generate the most wealth and productivity in the economy and you will find more college educated and open-minded people there.  The more educated someone is the more money they make and taxes they pay and so the educated end up paying more into the system while high-school dropouts are a drag.  This is a basic mechanic for how our society functions and there is no way to change that because it's just the way things are.  So we argue endlessly online about your side versus my side with no real conclusion. Stop letting one rural vote count for two urban ones. The deal a bunch of landed gentry made in the 1700s to ensure permanent oligarchy of the wealthy is still doing its job. This crap is very much fixable.

BlueOrange,"He sure does not know the difference between his mouth and his hole ..they both spit out shit... Of all the boring pathetic things MAGA cultists do claiming that criticism of Trump is going to magically get him reelected is the weirdest. Do you really think you'll trick us into ending our criticism that way?EDIT: Also the ""LOL you liburlz just don't know when he's joking"" bit is part of the long history authoritarians have of pretending that they're joking when you call them out. Sartre said this about antisemites and it applies just as well to the modern MAGA cultist:Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for by giving ridiculous reasons they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely they will abruptly fall silent loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”Deflecting legitimate criticism of lunatic ranting or bigotry with ""it's just a joke jeez you're so humorless"" is old old old. We've seen through your lies cousin. I think they believe they're comparing criticism of trump to how redcaps criticize Cortez and Beto. Like how people started thinking they were cooler because the criticisms make them seem more human. And it made them more popular and more likeable. Criticisms of Donny for spewing shit is not in that catagory of likeable things.To them: criticizing dancing in high school on video and being a punk rock skateboarder = hyperbole of being a total piece of shitNot sure if I said that clearly enough but yall get the jist Whatever lies you need to tell yourself to get through the night. I don’t think any of the hyperbolic criticisms you’re claiming are being lobbed at Trump can come close to the outright lies and conspiracy theories lodged against HRC in 2016. The only reason it wouldn’t also work against Trump is because he has done everything to appeal to people with no critical thinking skills those who are weak-minded enough to join cults. Therefore he’s like Jim Jones to these people - the only one telling them the truth about anything. Trump does terribly with the college educated who are badly outnumbered by their uneducated counterparts . Yeah institutions of facts and learning tend to have a liberal bias don’t they? Trump has certainly short circuited rationality that’s for sure bud. They’ve been ‘silly lib’ but even my university had a sizable ‘anti-government towards the cause of true equality’ libertarians; those seem to be the two outcomes of the mind that’s been tasked with processing how power structures work. I’m fine with big or small government but huge and extremely bad governments are unacceptable. Sizing down the government is agreeable but wholesale destruction seems risky. He won because nobody believed he would. Except for the crazies like QAnon he excited. And for that reason people just rolled their eyes at his stupidity and stayed home on election day. Even then he lost the popular vote. Yet now that the people who were sure he wouldn't win are actually scared he could and even a large number of his original voters are now aghast at the mans stupidity demonstrated since taking office you seriously think he's going to win again? He's going to win again because he lies about everything? That's quite sad for our country if that's true. Please explain the difference between lies exaggeration and/ or rhetoric... Sorta seems like YOU don't know. You're right the only politician who lies is Hilary. Not all of them epecially not Trump he's the only honest one. /S Each one of those things he said he's an expert on is a lie. It's not rhetoric or an exaggeration it's a lie.A simple rule of thumb if it's not true it's a lie. A lie is a lie no matter if it’s from a liberal or conservative politician. There are no “alternative facts.” There is the truth and then there is not the truth aka a lie. Whether one realizes they are lying or not does not make a lie they are telling not a lie. I guess its civil war time then right? /s It's weird that you believe that. ""quit calling us stupid or we'll do something stupid to spite you!""

progress18,"I’m interested to see open debate on ideas into stopping the abuses carried forth by the parties. Including legislation put forth which will prevent recurrence.If that means we need to entertain a different election process change in federal holidays campaign finance reform rules for redistricting etc - BRING IT ON. Otherwise it’s business as usual and we will all end up another year with the same old shit. The Constitution left the composition of the Electoral College up to the states. The political parties decided to divide the College between themselves and fill its ranks with partisan loyalists.This is just one way the two parties function as a cartel (a mutual power-sharing arrangement designed to exclude competition).Nowhere does the Constitution allow the federal or state governments to be owned and operated by a private political cartel especially where the cartel is operating principally for its own benefit.But here we are. And it's not working.And I mean our federal government is literally not functioning due to the cartel's internal bickering. The two party system is a natural consequence of the first past the post system with single member districts. No cartel is required. I didn't say it was required. I said it exists.Does the current two-party system purposefully create unique barriers to prevent other parties from meaningful participation?Yes; therefore it's a cartel. Perhaps I was unclear (always possible!)I didn't say that YOU said it's required to have a two-party system but you implied that it is by using the phrase cartelization (cartelization implies imposed barriers to entry which is why there tend to be oligopolies in cartelized situations.) There are requirements built into cartelized situations. Otherwise why would there be a cartel in the first place?My point is that even excluding any barriers to entry imposed by American political parties (and there are some though not as many as people think) the system would tend toward two parties by virtue of being a FPTP SMD electoral system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law). It's certainly not absolute but even assuming a third party sprouted up it's likely we'd still see two coalitions (left/right) to take the place of the existing big tent parties.The point I was making was more that there is no specific cartelization going on here: it's a natural consequence of the system itself.You use the presidency as the example which is fair. But that doesn't explain why pretty much every other district in American politics is effectively two party. The M + 1 calculation works pretty effectively in this case. Cartel party theory is far less explanatory for this particular outcome than the simple nature of the system itself. (Interestingly cartel party theory has some more interesting applications in Western Europe: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/cartel-party-thesis-a-restatement/458996C30EF168AF3A13A3134AA1ACCE and https://ecpr.eu/Filestore/PaperProposal/77c01c49-8fe0-4c5f-a83e-c64362debb30.pdf)I'd make the case that the US is a weaker example of cartel party theory on the grounds that it was never required for the two parties to engage in such behavior: they naturally ended up there by virtue of the electoral system itself. but even assuming a third party sprouted upThere is no shortage of ""third parties"" in American politics. They functionally have little if any chance of election due to the barriers to entry that the Democrat/Republican cartel has created.They don't form coalitions. They're simply marginalized.The point I was making was more that there is no specific cartelization going on here:And the point I'm making is that I don't think you're correct. Did you read any of the research that has sprung around Duverger’s work?It’s actually an incredibly well-studied phenomenon in electoral politics— from Duverger to Cox the political science research mostly agrees on the topic at least as far as the US is concerned.What specific barriers to entry do you think are more pertinent than the natural outcomes in a FPTP SMD system? What specific structural changes do you think would change this other than an overhaul of how we elect politicians?https://www.morningsidecenter.org/teachable-moment/lessons/could-us-move-beyond-two-party-systemhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/27/why-are-there-only-two-parties-in-american-politics/?utm_term=.642b3dd5b7d4It’s fine that you think I’m wrong but I studied a lot of the electoral policy literature and the single largest explanatory factor in the US system was always the SMD SNTV system. And it wasn’t just Cox who concluded it either.But I’m all ears. I admit it’s been a decade since I actively studied the topic. All the barriers to entry don't just naturally occur merely by virtue of the existence of a FPTP system.Some even arguably most of the barriers to entry are created purposefully. Therefore it's not incidentally a cartel. It's purposefully a cartel. Right. But which BTE are you referring to exactly? And assuming they were removed do you think districts would then trend toward multiple parties or would we have regional two party systems like in India?Put another way: why do FPTP SMD systems all trend toward two parties in general? Right.Okay then we're not arguing. We're agreeing. what “cartel”?It’s literally not functioning due to an immature and unqualified narcissistic leading the Executive Branch. That is certainly part of it yes. my biggest gripe with the electoral college is that by living in a more populated state  your vote is automatically worth less than someone living in a less populated state “No Mr. President. This bill doesn’t have to do with you... Investigation? Whose heard of that? This is about uhh Oobama. Yeah just sign here.” WE WILL BUILD A WALLof protection for the independent council.

Because low income people and people of color are less likely to have the time money or documentation necessary to get a valid ID.You already have to prove citizenship when you register to vote so why is this additional step necessary? Also states that implemented voter ID saw swings to the right once only living citizens could vote. Gonna need proof for all of this.  My quick 10 seconds on google shows all of this to be pure sophistry. The Electoral College made sense in the 18th-19th Century with limitations they had to truly do a national election.This has been moot for over a century though.And I cannot wait to hear the stupidity used to defend why the POTUS should be able to pardon themself. what limitations are you talking about? When the Electoral College was created there would have been no practical way to hold a national election based on a popular vote.  The United States even what existed then was a large area with sparse populations.  Imagine trying to coordinate and report election results and having no quick way to send them. Damn right it would take MONTHS to transport news of all the results by horseback.

If we assume that Trump is working for Putin which seems obvious to me after he announced removing US troops from Syria.

Add the fact that Trump said he'd let the Shutdown go for a year plus.

I think Putin ordered Trump to shut down the government and leave it shut down until all the federal workers quit since they need money to live.  He even announced after the shutdown begin that he was cancelling all federal pay raises.

This will put Nancy Pelosi next in line to be president and then she can use an executive order to overturn funding for the wall. Well good that we are taking care of the illegals finally but there’s much better ways to do this and cheaper ways as well. But don’t waste time by shutting the government down.

LMAO Crime statistics say otherwise so I’m not interested in your personal incredulity. Even if what you’re saying is true a wall won’t make the us any safer due to the fact that most illegal immigrants cross the border legally. That doesn’t make sense we’re taking about illegal immigrants not legal but I do agree a wall is a waste of money I think trump is hired by the Russians to destroy our country. He is literally shutting the government down for a pointless waste of money to put us in more debt and acting like an idiot it’s just way too sketchy!

progress18,I don't see any reason he wouldn't be impeached at this point. Now removing him from office that's a different fight and an uphill battle once impeachment passes the house and moves to senate. I remain convinced neither will happen and we'll need to rely on voting him out in 2020. The GOP obstruction machine is too powerful and Democrats never have the balls they do. Impeachment seems like a hand slap. The dude is working for our enemy who we are at war with and has recently surrendered to them and another enemy ISIS. What does it take from someone in Congress to say the T word so we can get some heads rolling? We should have a speaker of the house who says that they will impeach. I'm pretty sure there's a sizeable portion of people here who will find something to complain about no matter what. She knows what she's doing; let her do it. In the next month the house democrats need to pass legislation that addresses key issues that matter to people. Then when the mueller investigation is over and the report is public act on whatever the situation requires. Obviously Trump is not fit for office but it shouldn’t be task #1. This guy gets it I believe the elderly are out future help them not grow and let them lead the way.I think that's how the tune goes. If Gen X hadn't dropped the ball in terms of leadership capabilities this wouldn't be such a major cultural issue...but here we are. Boomers cling to power while Millenials are discounted. We have a SERIOUS leadership gap in this country right now and this failure extends to both major parties. Gen X is the smallest subset of the population that's why we're called the forgotten generation. I meet far more people older than me and younger than me than I do people my own age. I wanted Joe Crowley... then Cortez unseated him. Except he can still do it Tbf. No  as of right now there is no chance that Dems get 2/3 of Senate needed for removal. Pelosi is making the smart move of pursuing Trumps tax returns and cash flows in order to inevitably dig up something that would put public pressure on him. You just have to find the right time to do it. Since pushing impeachment up to the Senate multiple times will just dull things and lose importance for it to the public. Go Nancy go! Can we focus on other things? The senate wouldn't convict even if he confessed. How about you work on legalizing weed gun regulations minimum wage... taxing churches. How exactly would you get those things done with a Republican senate?Does anyone in this subreddit know how the legislature works? I can see legalization passing actually and I'd rather be able to say they tried to get shit done rather than they spent 2 years on an impossible task. As far as I know federal legalization isn't even part of the DNC platform and you'd need to flip several Republicans too. Not even all Democrats are on board let alone Republicans. It's not even something they've been talking about at the national level really. It would make zero sense for her to rule it out until she knows the results of the Mueller investigation. Why is it even a question? Smoke em. Smock em. How about rule it the fuck in and get to work? I want to see Mueller convict Pence Trumps remaining cabinet members his son his son in Law and his daughter. And I want the GOP senators who are working for foreign agents to be jailed too.Then we impeach Trump Try him for Treason and have a fucking huge parade honoring his execution and the end of his criminal empire.

anima-vero-quaerenti,Term limits do nothing to fix corruption and only exacerbates problems.  It's a good sounding solution that doesn't actually fix anything. It just effectively reduces experience.If you get rid of franking rights and beef up campaign finance laws again that might help reduce the incumbency rate fairly but there's no reason to force out good representatives based on their tenure in office. And with less experienced legislators you get more powerful lobbyists. They are only doing this because they are afraid of the left taking back over.

progress18,"Here’s an idea: during government shutdowns we also cut pay to Congress and the President so there is a greater incentive to avoid a shutdown. Agreed. Their pay perks and benefits should be the first items on the chopping block. I remember reading about some Japanese company where the ceo cut his pay and cut pay from his executives to keep the company afloat instead of cutting from the bottom during some economic hardships. eventually the company went back up and  profited more. I forget what company it was. It was Nintendo. When the Wii U/3DS markdown system failed the ceo of nintendo Iwata took a 50% pay cut for his salary to keep his staff and everyone who had worked on the Wii U/3DS because he stated a company that fires its employees when things get tough is not a good company. He also stated if his employees would have to worry about getting laid off how will the company continue to function? That's neat. I think it was sega The problem with this is that shutdowns could become a weapon with which they could ""starve out"" members of Congress that have less money (AOC comes to mind) since the salary is pretty inconsequential to most of them. Liberals shitting on other liberals is the greatest American past time though. I think she is pretty cool myself and am excited to see what she does next but yeah proof is in the pudding. She needs to put up or shut up.Only commenting because you’re getting flamed for having an opinion and I think that’s dumb. Liberals shitting on other liberals is the greatest American past time though.It’s how we continue to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory time and again. I'm not so sure. That would give the wealthiest members of Congress more leverage over the poorest members. The wealthy can afford the cut pay but the others would suffer. We'd see more concessions to the interests of the wealthiest Americans in the bill that's produced. We have that in California. Haven’t had a shutdown in decades. So you think Trump is living on his government pay?   His US government pay? This makes sense on paper but google the net worth of the average senator. You know he's only doing that to avoid mandatory reporting of all income right?Edit: publicly reporting You know there is no proof he is donating his salary right? His “word” isn’t proof. Is there actual proof that he is donating his salary? Even if I believed that he's spent way more than enough on tax-funded vacations to his own businesses to offset that. I’m aware. Yes but he still has an entire other government to support him. Zing! Will they get back pay? It's less a faucet and more a damn. The money is backing up behind it and when the funding is restored the damn will be removed all at once. The problem is that low pay non essential government workers are going without pay when they live paycheck to paycheck. Getting that money all at once when the shutdown ends isn’t all that great if you’ve been evicted or had to take out thousands of dollars in loans with interest to cover your normal bills. Oh I get that. I was explaining what was happening to their money that's all. Ah. Cool beans. My apologies for preaching to the proverbial choir. Yes. Nonessential government workers do get back pay.

therecordcorrected,"Some good ideas here about urban/rural and globalism vs internationalism. What seems underplayed is the difficulty of separating insecurity about globalism from straight up racism. I try to have empathy for Trump voters but too much of what we’re calling “understandable nationalism” is just the most recent cover story for long-standing racism. And that’s been here far longer than Trump. If Nationalism is the idea that our country is the best then there are actual arguments that could be made that have nothing to do with racism. America's foundational values are actually pretty great but they only remain so as much as they are open to anyone. Anyone can become an American. I think nationalism is more about protecting our interest/dominance than declaring our greatness per se. People from various political perspectives have taken the “greatness-of-America” position including cosmopolitan liberals. So perhaps we are not disagreeing?  I’m saying nationalism is great cover for racism and that makes good faith conversations hard. Some folks have been racist for a lifetime but can now operate disingenuously under the banner of nationalism. Trump has actively contributed to the intermingling of nationalism and racism in my view. He’s further confusing an already complex matter. Yes “Protecting national interests” is a much better way of phrasing it since “promoting our common values” is an important part of that. You’re right people like Stephen Miller who use nationalistic language as a front for racist ideology forget that aspect. If the US was no longer willing to let anyone who wasn’t looking to build a better life for themselves become part of the American Dream... then their nationalism is hollow and meaningless. Using that idea of the American Dream as the central point for promoting your other national interests seems like a perfectly valid argument. First fuck EJ Dionne.Secondly WTFThe challenge for the left and for all advocates of humane immigration policies is to move the debate from angry abstractions about “open borders” and toward a practical engagement with basic questions:What level of immigration is optimal at this moment for the nation as a whole? What will it take to reach a consensus for creating a path toward citizenship for immigrants who are here illegally? And how do we build a stronger civic culture that acknowledges the rights but also the duties of the native-born and immigrants alike?Who needs Republicans when Democrats like Dionne make their arguments for them?How about instead of pretending the racists have legitimate points we tell them to fuck off?The imaginary immigration problem is just like the imaginary drug problem; the problem is neither immigrants nor drugs the problem is the shit headed laws and the shit headed people who support them. Just like with pot stop making it illegal to immigrate and you won't have illegal immigration.The problems isn't hard working people risking their lives to get here. The problem is Americans who exploit those hard working people because they are ""illegal."" Asshats like Dionne  don't give a fuck about the people who are being screwed they just want to make it easier on their own consciences when poor people get fucked over by pro-business governments. I like the segment you quoted from Dionne actually. These are good questions to work through as a society. Immigration policy can be informed by good answers. Thinking seriously about how to integrate diverse cultures in communities and how public policy can realistically support that isn’t a racist or Republican project. I think Dionne just means liberals need to embrace practical action and the tools of government to address this and that should be a strength.

You’re posting this because it shows his penchant for speaking bluntly? It's important that people understand that just because someone is a Retired Army General does not mean they are trustworthy and show good judgement.  As said by President Obama. His bad judgement was that he was too blunt not that he made bad military decisions or anything else. Nowhere in the article was it suggested that his viewpoint was unfounded his mistake was going on the record with his views.So if your intention was to downplay the significance of the general’s assessment  the article is not a good piece of evidence. trump Lies - https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=opinion-c-col-right-region&region=opinion-c-col-right-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-right-region&_r=0Crazy-trump’s conspiracy theories - http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/58-donald-trump-conspiracy-theories-and-counting-definitive-trump-conspiracy-guidetrump attacks Russia Inquiry - but here’s what’s true: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/18/us/politics/fact-check-trump-russia-election-interference-.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fpolitics I misread the title as ""immortal"" and was truly terrified for a second...

jamalwhite70,"Radical Conservative Christians are a threat to this country's democracy. How can you be a radical conservative? The definition of conservative is “holding traditional attitudes and values and cautious about change or innovation” and radical means “advocating or based on thorough or complete political or social change; representing or supporting an extreme or progressive section of a political party” so how could you be extremely progressive about holding traditional values? The majority of these radical conservatives do not wish for social progress nor see changes made in society.Many of these so-called conservatives do not want to see changes such as civil rights same-sex marriage womans rights ect.If it were up up these conservatives society would still ""embrace"" the cultural values of the 1950's If you don’t mind me asking what were the cultural values of the fifties and what are changes that are needed in the world under the categories of civil rights same sex marriage and women’s rights? In the 1950s interracial marriages was mostly frowned upon. Same-sex marriage let alone same-sex couples was unheard of and certainly frowned upon.Many of these radical conservatives do not like the current state of society where there are interracial marriages same-sex marriages women allowed to work.Many states are passing a law where they want to execute women who have an abortion or ""miscarriage"" while claiming to be pro-lifeSocial progress and acceptance is important for society in order for it to grow. By Clinging On to Old beliefs Society cannot and will not advance for the betterment of its people. Well now same sex marriage is not frowned upon nor is interracial marriage and I haven’t heard of the law executing women for getting abortions can I see a source on that? Not a law yet.

White evangelicals are the bedrock of that opposition and are the largest Christian demographic in the United States making up the majority of the GOP base.The GOP had in their national platform that they disagree with the Supreme Court ruling that legalized same sex marriage nationwide. So much so that they want that decision repealed as well as Windsor’s which repealed the federal ban on same sex marriage as well as an advocate for banning gay marriage nationwide via state by state or a constitutional amendment.Out of 50 states 44 state GOP parties directly oppose same sex marriage only 4 take no direct stance. 1 state (Arizona) wants to abolish marriage itself to prevent having to give gay couples licenses. And only 1 (Rhode island) GOP outright supports it.So yes the dominant political party in the US still strongly frowns upon same sex marriage.",0,False,t3_ab1701,10,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/ab1701/conservative_christians_were_the_political_pawns/,12,,Conservative Christians Were The Political Pawns Of 2018 | HuffPost,12,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-trump-conservative-christians_us_5c267b7de4b08aaf7a9044e4

BlueOrange,"Pretty sure two other's died and were released days prior in really dire health and then died.  Also because this is being done by mercenary contractors the children dying that we are hearing about aren't likely to be the only ones. That is two too many you asshole. How would he feel it were his children? How would he feel if it were his children?That's a question he's not capable to ask himself. All this Republican ""they shouldn't have broken the law"" posturing is just so they can mentally draw a line between ""good"" kids like theirs who deserve to live and ""bad"" brown kids who don't. Dehumanizing dead children saves this kind of people the cognitive dissonance of going to church every Sunday while punishing kids for being poor. I agree I should have said Republican officials. I'm not ready to give any of them a pass because they know exactly what they're doing. this article talks about why building a border fence  in the nineties actually increased illegal immigration. this link shows that undocumented immigrants pay billions  in taxes  and as for youre statement that they cause harm? I will point you to this link which shows undocumented immigrants committ fewer crimes than the general population.  So to argue that the ""liberal"" solution is bad as the conservative one suggests you haven't really thought it through. I would also argue that undocumented immigrants are still human beings and the conservative solution being utterly heartless should be a strike against it as well.  But many would disagree. That bringing empathy into politics isn't a solid science based way to make a policy opinion.  So that last bit is just my bleeding heart's 2 cents.Either way there's no reason to escalate border security the way conservatives seem to want to  as the data shows it's not effective and human beings (innocent children) are literally dying because of it. I would say the conservative solution is actively harmful in a way the liberal one is not. It's not unfair generalization to say an acting member of the Republican party is approving or complicit in racist actions they are currently taking and racist messaging they are delivering.Wishy washy ""bad people on both sides"" is bad for society not calling a spade a spade. Don't run on a neofacist racially driven platform of building a wall to keep the rapists and murderers out and ""make America great again"" and then double down and defend that for two years and then wonder why it's fair to call a party and their members racist. His children wouldn’t be in ICE custody.  But I’d imagine he’d show more empathy and compassion though. Not only is Steve King ruthless but he’s also clueless.

BlueOrange,"Finally! He came in first (last?) place in a contest! Naturally it's on Netflix and Amazon Prime. They love ultra right wing and conspiracy movies. I don’t think Netflix or amazon prime should take a side politically there’s plenty of money to be made on both sides here. Censorship is never the answer. Conspiracy films have nothing to do with politics. Dude liberals use amazon and Netflix too What? Netflix basically redid its entire rating system because of Amy Schumer Huh? And I was talking about content not ratings. Naturally however the right wing and conspiracy movies get thousands of top ratings. But the left wing movies getting thousands of top ratings is acceptable?Because the top 3 documentaries on Netflix are ""13th"" ""Icarus"" and ""Strong Island""""13th"" and ""Strong Island"" are both about racial inequality with a left leaning bias.

Yield exactly nothing or be pathetic and weak your choice. They will piss out like always. Of course let's not forget.....the government shutting down hurts Trump not even a little bit.  It does hurt millions of government workers though.Why not change the narrative?  Instead of having a political party whose entire platform is ""we are not them"" try standing up for actual issues.  Here's an idea....Trump wants a boondoggle wall?   How about every dollar spent on that one dollar is invested in the Affordable Care Act?  Force the Republicans to invest in good things to get their useless wall. You seem to be misinformed.  There is NO immigrant crisis - we don't need a wall.  It's wasted money and the wall will be torn down by whoever becomes the next president.Instead of spending Twenty to Eighty Billion on trump’s dumb racist WALL… why doesn’t trump spend Twenty to Eighty Billion on housing for homeless veterans? Because Trump isn't going to do that because he's an asshole.We don't need a wall but the Republican party and most importantly Trump does.  It's time to play politics and get actual good legislation in trade for this.   If the wall is useless (as I certainly believe) then play these idiots like a violin give them that but get stuff they hate in return.  It's a waste of money but it will give some jobs and most importantly it's a huge bargaining chip. Then get a majority and override his veto. We don't need to cave on this wall BS. What majority are you talking about?  You got 20 Republicans in the Senate that you are targeting for flipping?   It takes a 2/3 majority.It's fun to hate Trump but this government shutdown is bad for a whole lot of regular people.     It could be used to do a lot of good despite Republicans having a majority in the Senate and the Presidency. You are absolutely right it is hurting Americans. Which is why the narrative should be 'Trump is hurting Americans so we pay for the wall he said Mexico would be paying for'.Donald doesn't know how to take no for an answer this is a great time to teach him that very important lesson. He doesn't get to shut down the government every time he doesn't get his way and we sure as hell don't cave in and give the toddler what he wants.

And 2.4 was the previous raise.A literal 10% increase would be SO hard for them to sign off on. Which baffles me.I remember being active duty and whenever a high ranking official came through we lost all the free time we would have had and instead had to go stroke the bastard's ego.

Yea they must put something in the water or have a sonic tool that they play🤣 Probably were told to applaud so he doesn't send them to invade G-INA. That and they were pumped to be getting a 10% pay raise. If you believe they are getting a pay raise you should lay off the coolaid. Well Trump told the truth...from a certain perspective. Last year the troops got a 2.4% raise. Trump told them he got them a 10% raise but just failed to mention it was 10% of last year's raise which comes out to the 2.6% raise this year.Because he's a clown. A bloated orange clown. There’s the  tiny grain of “truth” that fuels most disinformation campaign. So last year's raise + 10%.That's not perspective it's not understanding how the English language and numbers work.

easyone,"Fuck the NRA and anyone who supports them.  May you rest on your own bullets I am interested how to reconcile the validity and necessity of what Marx is saying and the clear and present modern problem with gun violenceedit: downvotes with no actual discussion? Which part do you disagree with? is the Karl Marx part the scary word for you all? Marx would likely understand that gun violence in the U.S. is the result of broken systems that do not allow for a stable working class.Proponents of gun control like to talk about countries lie Japan or Iceland who have significant gun control measures and nearly non existant gun crime. But those countries look nothing like the U.S. on a socioeconomic level.Socioeconomically the U.S. is more similar to a country like Brazil which has gun control measures that many Democrats would salivate over. Yet their gun crime is atrocious.I am not a member of the NRA. But I do think that at best gun control would be a high-effort-low-yeild way of combating gun violence.Marx would likely say that to reduce crime you must address the social and economic instability that lead to crime in the first place. Marx would likely say that to reduce crime you must address the social and economic instability that lead to crime in the first place.Which is unfortunate because it's also something most normal people would say. You put Marx name on it and people lose their minds. Marx would likely say that to reduce crime you must address the social and economic instability that lead to crime in the first place.This is the real answer answer. But american politics only produces band-aid fixes that are demonstrable and beneficial during the political election cycle. Any fix like you recommend would take too long for any politician to really stand behind the cost and expense that wont be realized and see the benefits for 50 years. This is not accounting for the late stage capitalism issues that financially bennefit from the ""social and economic instability""but holy shit im sitting at -4 and you are 0 upvotes. and last time I checked this was /r/Liberal. How is this not a ""liberal"" idea? Im 100% not a conservative but apparently I dont have liberal ideas either? All i know is Reddit is chuck full of En Are A bots at all times and they will downvote  anything sensible into oblivion. They are the bully with the gun. Never forget this. They are the paranoid mentality unstable neighbor and the people who orchestrate and profit from a hate and fear factory. I will never give them an ear or an inch. They have taken far too much already. It sickens me deeply. Most conservatives don’t actually like the NRA. A lot of them disagree with them bc of the whole stance on bump stocks among other things. Yea. We hear from these conservatives all the time how they disagree with the NRA....  and how they don’t vote for politicians who are NRA supported.Never. I call them Flake Republicans. Sure they're concerned and vocal about their opposition. But put a ballot in front of them and it's suddenly single issue voter time... The only way we will slow needless deaths and gun violence is to elect candidates who support common sense gun legislation. And the only way to get these candidates elected is to participate in the process. This means getting involved in campaigns or electoral grassroots organizations. And the only way to get more people participating is if doctors show grisly pictures of people destroyed by guns. Both extremes of the guns debate are horrendously bad at selling their view to the center antecdote based tear jerk articles like this exemplify why. Show me some data that if you take guns the murders won't immediately be replaced with other types of murder like they were in Australia and the UK. Literally trained scientists. Most doctors are not trained scientists. That an interesting perspective and one that is linguistically defined in the conflict.If you mean they aren’t working professionally as scientists outside research medicine you are correct.If you mean they aren’t trained as scientists as part of their training that would be incorrect; blood lab diagnostic assessments etc. all follow the scientific method which they are trained in.My comment was they are literally trained as scientists not they are working as scientists. If you mean they aren’t trained as scientists as part of their training that would be incorrect; blood lab diagnostic assessments etc. all follow the scientific method which they are trained in.No that would be incorrect as well. Science is a rigorous set of steps of research hypothesis testing etc. whereas what you are describing is diagnostic tests. The vast vast majority of doctors are not trained scientists. Most are terrible at statistical analysis unless they are also trained epidemiologists.My comment was they are literally trained as scientists not they are working as scientists.Even that were true that they don't actively engage in science means they are probably aren't thinking or acting as scientists and thus their opinions on the topic are not scientifically informed. Dude or Dudette. I have been a paramedic 38 years and I have seen hundreds of people shot with legally purchased handguns. Funny it seems like I recall Sandy Hook happening because one of those lawful gun owners took no steps to prevent her mentally ill child from accessing her guns and murdering children.  I guess you are just fine with dead kids. Look - I’m a long time gun owner - hand guns and shotguns. I shot BB guns as a child then 22s now .45s and shot guns. I’m no anti-gun guy. At this point advocating for no change means you are fine with schools being shot up. There is no other option. What we’re doing now isn’t working and kids AREN’T getting shot up under other systems. Speaking nice isn’t going to change Trump fans’ minds nor will it 2nd Amendment purists. Embarrass them. Full disclosure: I’m not a gun owner. I’m a wussy PNW millennial who was raised by hippie parents and hasn’t shot anything bigger than an air soft gun.The problem is that it doesn’t embarrass them it just shows them how (in their eyes) “unhinged and ignorant liberals are.” It’s not that they don’t care about dead children they believe (possibly wrongly) that over the aggregate in the “good guy with a gun” scenario and that tighter gun controls will make it more dangerous for kids. Whether it’s wrong or it’s right it’s what they believe and there’s a lot of evidence that can be read to support it (especially w/r/t gun free zones).Karl Rove is a piece of shit but he’s also brilliant in the way he figured out that attacking someone on their strengths was more effective than on their weaknesses (see: swiftboating). We need to be taking the best faith argument and attacking it head on with data and reasoning. Ad hominem attacks only strengthen their echo chamber and makes it look like there’s no logic to support gun control. It’s akin to when they talk about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s support of Democratic socialism and say “she just doesn’t care about the 70 million that Mao murdered!”I agree that a certain percentage of right wingers won’t ever listen to the other side. I don’t know for sure how big that percentage is but we won’t get anywhere without trying to bring the good ones to the table. This person is a concern troll. Their objective is to inject immotive passion into the debate... Not solutions. When small children are killed at school and one side just digs in further to prevent and change from happening please tell me how we should not see that as them saying they are okay with dead children?Or better yet explain why even dead first graders aren't enough for the other side to agree it is time to do something.Because no in the absence of intelligent answers to those questions it needs to be brought up ad nauseam to drive the point home of the reality the other side is blind to or worse yet endorses. You’re not even a good troll account. Posting on Liberal and t_d... come on kid Strawman. Still doesnt negate the facts in the article. Guns kill people. Period. Stop obfuscating the facts. Statistically you’re more likely to hurt yourself or someone else than defend yourself with a gun. But sure imagine that you’re able to be the hero. When someone walks into my home with a firearm - what else am I supposed to do?  Seriously?  Do I just run and hide and pray to god that they don’t find my kids or other family members?  Do I try to defend myself and my family with a knife or a bat?  Do I hide in a closet to call 911 and have to wait for ten minutes before a good guy with a firearm to shows up - all whilst hoping they don’t find my family members?I refuse to be a victim.  And restrictive gun laws will ONLY hurt law abiding citizens while they bolster the aggressiveness of armed criminals.  Just because you ban firearms - it’s not going to just stop criminals from getting them and using them against you.We outlawed drugs.  We still suffer from a massive drug epidemic - that is the cause of most violence.We have outlawed drinking and driving.  Yet people die daily from getting hit by drunk drivers.We’ve outlawed rape.  And people still get raped.Do you not remember what prohibition did to the underground alcohol business?  It was illegal - yet it was still readily available.  And huge crime families were formed and very very well compensated for it.Do you not find it a little strange that even Parkland HS has decided the best route to defend themselves and their students is by arming teachers and other staff?It’s absolutely unfair that you have the right to make myself and my family victims - while criminals will carry on with business as usual with firearms.It’s so hilarious when I hear politicians talk about gun restrictions or an outright ban - yet they are protected 24/7 with people with firearms.I don’t imagine being a hero.  I’m absolutely sickened of the thought of taking someone’s life.  And I pray to god that I never have to use deadly force to protect myself my family my friends or even strangers.You people are absolutely unable to use very basic logic.  And in the simplest terms - here is the outcome of gun bans.I’d have to turn over my firearms or I’d lie and say that I don’t own any anymore.  Then I get into a situation to where a gun toting criminal can literally do whatever he pleases with me or my family.  You’ve single handedly forced me to give up my only means of protection.  And if I did lie and killed the intruder with a firearm - I get charged with murder.The only thing that will change your mind is if you get confronted by a gun toting criminal.  And by then it’s too late.  Then there’s the possibility that they outright kill you. When someone walks into my home with a firearm - what else am I supposed to do?  Seriously?  Do I just run and hide and pray to god that they don’t find my kids or other family members?Yes because statistically that’s the course of action that’s least likely to result in violence against you by the criminal.I refuse to be a victim.  And restrictive gun laws will ONLY hurt law abiding citizens while they bolster the aggressiveness of armed criminals.A viewpoint contradicted by every other nation that’s prohibited the possession and production of firearms.We outlawed drugs.  We still suffer from a massive drug epidemic - that is the cause of most violence.Drugs are easier to make and easier to sneak into the country.We have outlawed drinking and driving.  Yet people die daily from getting hit by drunk drivers.At lower levels than before. Just because a law doesn’t entirely stop the problem it aims to doesn’t mean it’s useless.We’ve outlawed rape.  And people still get raped.Again less than when it wasn’t outlawed.Do you not remember what prohibition did to the underground alcohol business?  It was illegal - yet it was still readily available.  And huge crime families were formed and very very well compensated for it.Are you arguing that producing alcohol and producing a firearm are similar levels of difficulty?Do you not find it a little strange that even Parkland HS has decided the best route to defend themselves and their students is by arming teachers and other staff?Yeah it means that they’ve realized that state or local levels of regulation don’t do as much as a federal regulation would because there are no significant barriers to movement across state lines.It’s so hilarious when I hear politicians talk about gun restrictions or an outright ban - yet they are protected 24/7 with people with firearms.Operating within a system doesn’t mean that you can’t advocate for changes to that system.The rest of your comment is a masturbatory diatribe about how you have a gun in the situation would result in anything other than gun violence against you and your family being more likely so I’m not going to address it. According to Psychology Today you are twice as likely to kill someone by accident than you are to have a “justified” reason to shoot someone.Source: https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/statistical-life/201701/the-true-odds-shooting-bad-guy-gun That's not a valid take on the matter though.  Accidental shootings are very rare but so is actually shooting someone when a gun is used in self defense.  They're trying to swing the numbers by only counting instances where someone was actually shot and discounting all the rest. In the last year for every one defensive use of a gun (including incidents where the gun did not go off) 7 people die and 13 people are injured by guns.Source: https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/Now I am going to turn it back on you. Please show me a source that says that the number of crimes averted by guns is higher than the number of crimes and accidents involving guns. You claim that you need a gun to protect yourself from criminals and there is a mountain of evidence saying that you are more-likely to kill or injure a non-criminal. Prove them wrong. That's not a valid source.  That's literally just a number some anti-gun organization pulled out of its ass.  They provide ZERO support for their false number. You can literally click on the numbers and they show a list of every incident the location a description and the news article where they got the incident from. That is an abundance of evidence with names addresses dates and media sources. Just because you dislike a fact does not make it untrue.Provide me with one incident on that website that ""some anti-gun organization pulled out of its ass"". Even anti gun sources put defensive gun use at 50x higher than that.  Think about the logic you're trying to use you're claiming the fact that they cite a few cases of defensive use as proof they have a complete archive of ALL uses.That's a VERY incomplete dataset designed to make defensive use look rare.  It's an extremely biased source looking to push fake data in the hopes of tricking people to support gun bans. OK then once more: please show me a source that says that the number of crimes averted by guns is higher than the number of crimes and accidents involving guns.Also while you're out there I am so interested in these ""anti gun sources put defensive gun use at 50x higher than that."" Please post the anti-gun site that lists 87000 cases of defensive gun use in 2018 with sources for every incident. The onus is on you to prove your statements. Unfortunately he/she is correct. All it takes is 1 time when you handle a firearm to have a negligent discharge. This is why you need to follow the 4 rules of gun safety every time you handle a firearm. Well...http://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/1814426/accessibility-firearms-risk-suicide-homicide-victimization-among-household-members-systematichttps://lawcenter.giffords.org/guns-in-the-homesafe-storage-statistics/“Having a gun in the home is associated with an increased risk of firearm homicide and firearm suicide regardless of storage practice type of gun or number of guns in the home.” Having a gun in the home is associated with an increased risk of firearm homicide and firearm suicide regardless of storage practice type of gun or number of guns in the home.This is true.  It's true for the same reason that most car accidents occur within 5 miles of a person's home. It's the same reason why the UK has a higher rate of cricket-bat injuries than the US. The truth of this statement is completely irrelevant.It's also true that armed victims of violent crime suffer fewer and less severe injuries than unarmed victims. It’s not an argument. Obviously everybody is entitled to believe whatever they want to but you asked for a source stating that gun owners are more likely than non-owners to be party to gun violence which were provided. You can add however many asterisks you want to in order to refute the studies I linked and that’s fine too - I didn’t write them it’s no skin off my back - but the studies were done and these were their findings statistically. They weren’t the one you asked for a source but their source literally states:Guns kept in the home are more likely to be involved in a fatal or nonfatal unintentional shooting criminal assault or suicide attempt than to be used to injure or kill in self-defense.And you chose to act like that isn’t talking about defending yourself. You’re very clearly not arguing in good faith and I’m glad I wasn’t around to see your comment first and take the effort to find you a source.“What about just showing off the gun” isn’t an argument dude. Strawman. They're are a lot of options short of weapon bans. Cool. Can you name one that the NRA won't dig their heels in and squeel ""THEY'RE COMMIN FER YER GUNNNNZ #THANKSOBUMMER"" for me? Because that's what happens any time someone says ""hey guys maybe we shouldn't sell weapons of war to the public."" Dude an AR15 is not a weapon of war.  No soldier in their right mind would carry an AR15 on to any battlefield on earth - or they’ll quite simply get out gunned.An AR15 is a hunting rifle - plain and simple.  My personal hunting rifle is an AR15 chambered in 6.5 Creedmore.  I hunt deer hogs coyotes rabbits bear wolves and literally any other animal you can think of.The reason we get pissed off when we hear the whole “ban AR15 now reeee” is because we know what it’ll lead to.  AR15s will get banned.  So we’ll start using AK47s SKS FNAR M1A Scars and the list just keeps going.  Then they’ll ban semi auto rifles in general - and now we’re stuck hunting with bolt action rifles.  And good fucking luck hunting a boar wolves bear and many other animals that may in fact charge you and fucking kill you if your shot doesn’t hit.  Or if you miss your first shot and they just fucking bolt - semi auto gives you the opportunity to send more rounds down range to hit your target.All the while bad people will STILL be murdering people with AR15s.You people lack all logic.  And when you talk about common sense laws?  Fucking ridiculous.  That’s like allowing a plumber to make restrictions and rules for pilots.But sure.  Keep stripping rights from your fellow law abiding citizens - all because you’re afraid of “the black rifle”.  Ban guns and people will still kill people with guns.  Ban AR’s and people will STILL kill people with ARs.  You’re just making it more difficult for innocent people to defend themselves and their families. Dude an AR15 is not a weapon of war. No soldier in their right mind would carry an AR15 on to any battlefield on earth - or they’ll quite simply get out gunned.An M16 is literally an AR-15 with burst fire added. We dont even use the M16 anymore dude.  We’ve switched to the M4A1 which has burst semi and auto.  Do some research you’re making yourself look dumb. First off M16s are still in use by 80 militaries around the world including the US secondly an M4 carbine is a smaller version of an M16 thirdly being obsolete wouldn't change the fact that an AR-15 is one selective fire mode away from being an actual military assault rifle. The point being an AR15 is not a weapon of war.  Ask any solider around the world - and they will not choose an AR15 vs anything with selective fire.

progress18,and Trump will give welfare to farmers because of policies he enacted. The farmers should all be drug tested before receiving any government aid. And be forced to work other jobs at the same time.And gerrymandered so that their votes don't matter anymore. The farmers getting these handouts are likely more familiar with lines of blow off an escort's ass than o'le Corky McMomnpop doin' meth off a troll's taint. Sarcasm or did I suddenly get teleported to /r/conservative? Well the government is shut down so all the money they were supposed to get can be saved up for The Wall right?  (Naturally *I* am joking but it looks like The Cheeto seriously believes it). The U.S. is borrowing money from China to pay our farmers for the lost business from...China.🤦‍♂️ Nobody knows politics better than Donald Trump! /s Declaration: I'm a Brit but I've lived in China for 8 years and have been married to a Chinese lady for 14 years so I'm probably somewhat biased.If your main supplier is behaving in a way you don't like or cannot tolerate then any business will find alternative supplies that's just business 101. If your original supplier then becomes less antagonistic it's still probable that you will stick with your replacement supplier otherwise you're just going to piss off two suppliers rather than one.I would therefore be very surprised if China switches back to US supplies any time soon even if the 'trade war' is resolved. Yeah well to reach that conclusion one would’ve had to thought things through. And you know there’s none of that happening the orange one’s head. Yup. That’s what critics said before this began. Trump is hurting farming without a doubt but all Americans pay for farming subsidies which will now have to be raised.

Any Democrat should just laugh - publicly - when this happens; point out some of the ways they defaulted in their duty and move on to policy stuff.edit: grammar This is exactly what I’ve been thinking. This chaotic free fall we’re in is really waking people up and making the younger generation realize they have to go out and actually vote. It’s exposing how shitty the US government can get so we can bounce back and project the country even further than it was before. no Republican can ever try to take the moral high ground on anythingOh but they will. We had eight years of a man in office who was the golden standard of how a president should behave and they lost their fucking minds.Any Democrat that laughs at Republicans trying will be turned into a “loss of civility” talking point without a hint of irony. The response should then be ""nice try.""edit: misspelling. I wish my Trump supporter family members would come to their senses but they're doubling down. Oh yeah.  It's possible very possible he could get re-elected.Dems have to focus on middle class jobs and needs.  Any focus on Identity Politics and horseshit issues will lose us the White House.

Yeah I agree and there are even some Liberals out there who are for pulling out of Syria and Afghanistan without informing our allies or own pentagon (people responsible for removing troops) before the decision was broadcast to the world via Twitter.Yay! Power vacuums and no critical thinking!!It’s pathetic. If Trump can destroy the ""let's invade everyone"" foreign policy of the USA he will have finally done one decent thing in his life. Nice thought but I am am not really seeing it. If he was at all serious about that he would stop supporting the war in Yemen. That is a tragic humanitarian crisis. This looks to be merely a play to his base and rolling on our back to Russia.The humanitarian cost for these actions is going to be horrible. Imagine you are a woman in Afghanistan or a translator or anyone who sided with Americans and believed their promises? The humanitarian cost for these actions is going to be horrible. Imagine you are a woman in Afghanistan or a translator or anyone who sided with Americans and believed their promises?Basically anyone would be a fool to trust us especially if the GOP is in power started the war or very likely to gain power again. Imagine you are a woman in Afghanistan or a translator or anyone who sided with Americans and believed their promises?Yep that would make you think twice before you trust an American again. Anyone with a brain would consider not siding with an invading army next time.Again this is a great way to end the USAs policy of invading small nations and murdering their civilians for profit and fun. He's also wanting to withdraw completely from Afghanistan and Iraq. Of course this is all in retaliation for not giving him the Great Wall of Trump and causing problems with his business interests in Saudi Arabia by ending Saudi support in Yemen. He's holding the entire Middle East hostage to get his wall. That’s really much to simplistic. There are ideals that the USA promotes and sometimes the ideals si ha s promoting democracy human rights and free trade that require a military presence which is not the same as invade everyone. Nothing says ""democracy and human rights"" like invading a nation and killing the fuck out of its people. Yeah Koreans were bombed and killed in the hundreds of thousands maybe even millions by good ol' democracy effots by the USA. Let's not forget the despotic regimes in Latin America supported by the US. Which us military anyone in the last 20 years so you think were unjustified besides (I assume) Iraq? All US military actions since September 2 1945 have been unjustified. Go ask anyone in South Korea or Kuwait or the civilians muammar gaddafi was using his airforce against or the victims of ethnic cleansing in kosovo or the Kurds if the US was wrong. Do the people who the US military murdered in Vietnam Nicaragua Guatemala Iraq and Afghanistan get to vote? Don't move the goal posts now. You had a chance to give a serious answer and you went with the most childish response imaginable. Now that I've proved your initial answer wrong you don't get to change it.Oh and the people who are victims of war always deserve sympathy because war is horrible and always results in innocent people suffering but the invasion of Afghanistan was completely justified by any reasonable measure. The Taliban harbored Al qaeda and Al Qaeda attached us. They murdered 3000 people specifically targeting civilians. The Taliban protected them. I have sympathy for innocent people who suffered from the invasion but the tal8ban was a state sponsor of terrorism and deserved to be overthrown.And for Iraq if you ask the Kurds they'll speak well of the us and the invasion generally. So there's that.As for Central and South America we were combating what were often Soviet backed insurgents. Stopping the Soviet Union spreading was a worthwhile goal. It was a series of proxy wars between the us and USSR. It's an understatement to say they were unfortunate but it's an overstatement to say it was unjustified.Somehow I don't get the impression you blame the USSR for their adventuring in South America.

progress18,"No offense intended but this one doesn't even seem all that subtle.https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/guess-who-came-dinner-flynn-putin-n742696 Lmao my extreme left roommate was all about Jill Stein during the election. Fuckin Russia played us like fools. Let's not forget she might be shady herself. Chick ""lost"" money that was supposed to be for a recount I didn’t know she lost it. I was wondering and should probably google why nothing came from the recount. With what we know now do you think it was to prevent any other group from requesting a recount? I'm not super well versed in it but as far as I know she's made no statement about the funds. I used to read the r/JillStein subreddit after Bernie lost the primary. I considered voting for her in this Democrat safe state to ""send a message"" but after a few days of that subreddit I couldn't stand it -- it was as bad as r/the_idiot so I decided against it. They actually turned me off of the green party and I was leaning that way before the primary.It was interesting to see that Russian trolls were active there and it explains what was going on and makes me feel better about my ability to sense the bullshit. If it helps the Green Party in Europe had a big freakout about the stuff Stein was saying. I dunno if they've officially booted out the US Green Party but it's pretty clear they're completely unmoored from each other. It's really sad. Other than their stance on a few science issues I'm far more aligned with their platform than the Democratic party but they keep putting forth nuts in local elections and then what I saw in that subreddit trashing Hillary while praising Trump just made me sick. Incredible how many young liberals are still sticking their heads in the sand as well.  I understand that it's a painful attack on your ego suggesting that your sincerely held beliefs are a product of being tricked.... But refusing to examine the evidence makes you as bad as Trumpers.There are still people insisting that Hillary really was the worst candidate ever and that fact caused them to independently decide not to vote.  Get over it new-left ya got got. ""We"" wanted Clinton to be our nominee. You have to be careful about how you think of different groups it can easily lead you to tribalism and a view of someone like Clinton as the enemy.As an extension of this ""we"" elected Trump too. Voting age Americans were asked if Trump or Clinton should be president and we chose Trump. Yes the electoral college helped him but the people of enough states selected Trump.You gotta vote. Voting age Americans were asked if Trump or Clinton should be president and we chose Trump.Actually more chose Clinton collectively (i.e. ""we"") but the electoral college doesn't weigh those votes equally. Bernie lost fair and square why the hell would Clinton have just handed over the nomination? I wouldn't say Bernie lost fair and square (given what happened in the Democratic Party during the primary process) but I definitely don't follow the logic that Clinton would ever have backed down and supported Bernie. Because it was obvious how popular he was. Instead we got this shit show that will bring our country down for years. I can’t change the past but it doesn’t mean I can’t be angry about it. So popular he lost the nomination? Your logic is flawed. That god-awful fake smile and the fact that she oozes slime is why.That isn't valid criticism.That Is exactly the kind of criticism that propaganda creates. Exactly.  Print 100 fake stories on her.  Even if none stick you'll have people like this saying ""she just gives me a bad vibe."" Where there is smoke there is fire. I disagree. I think we need to have a discussion about why Clinton or any woman in politics feels the need to paste on the fake smile and pretend to be unfazed when they face that kind of barely held back aggression and rank mendacity rather than express even a wisp of emotion.If we understand what was going on with her demeanor we take away its power to undermine not just her but any non traditional candidate. Because if women show emotion they get called hysterical. She cried once and  every front page was questioning her stability. I had never felt like I was truly represented until Hillary Clinton. If you’ve followed her from college she was and is a badass woman who has overcome and adjusted just as I assume I will. I don’t get the Hillary hatred just as I don’t understand the Pelosi hatred. It's all the hit pieces that inevitably target effective women politicians from the right. just as I don’t understand the Pelosi hatred.Nancy Smash. That's all the reason they need to hate her with the fire of a thousand boiling suns. How. Dare. They. Win. Agreed.  And it's such a shame that the negative attention spoiled what could have been a historic presidency.  People will never know what she's about now if they didn't care to learn. You've been taught to hate her since William Safire and the NYTimes told you too back when Bill was elected. Too flippant. I've never given a fig what Safire had to say about anything including on language. Most of the opposition to Hilary in the primary was from young people who don't even know who Safire is. Sure the olds who vote GOP hated her but they hate any liberal. And make no mistake ... Trump's deplorables showed up to vote against her for being an outspoken liberal. They used to claim Hilary was pulling Bill's strings because they perceived her as much more liberal than him in the 1990s. It would be hilarious if so much weren't at stake that a tranche of the far left thinks Hilary lost for being too right wing. They hate her because they were told to hate her by Bernie who used the exact talking points word for word by Safire and his bandwagon helmed eventually by Gingrich. Your point is valid as those who voted for Bernie and then Jill Stein gave no clue who these people are. Someone had to ""inform"" them. In conversations with Bernie supporters online and in person they all used the same exact talking points to describe her. Scary. As bad as Trump Supporters in their lock step rhetoric. While I didn't take it so far as to not vote for her I did not like Hillary Clinton as a candidate. That god-awful fake smile and the fact that she oozes slime is why. She absolutely fucking disgusted me during the primary debates.I think this is fair. This is my working theory right now. Keep in mind I'm not a cis person so I'm going off what cis women say about themselves.I think that for most of her political life Hilary Clinton was not allowed to show her true emotions. Politicians in general have to be cagey but people who aren't white males have to be much more subdued. We all know how Obama would hold it in although he was a master at it in a way (perhaps by some argue being excessively naive about the opposition). Women very much aren't allowed to be angry. The debates were very unnerving to me because the discord in her affect reminded me of my abusive mother. But I think that she felt she couldn't show what she really felt about Trump. So she does the long practiced fake smile.I thought about this because I saw the same fake sarcastic smile on Kamala Harris' face the other day. It was when she was speaking on the anti-lynching legislation and Hyde-Smith who said she would take a front row seat at a lynching was presiding. Now some people saw this as sweet irony but I think Harris' demeanor suggests she felt that Hyde-Smith was a disgrace to the Senate and shouldn't be there at all and it was a personal blow to her to have to put forward this legislation and stay calm and say nothing while Hyde-Smith was presiding. So I worked through my discomfort on Harris' expression because I think it's logical. In the same sense I think that's a good deal of why Clinton especially in the debate dealing with a man who is being actively bullying following her around and leaning over her has this bizarre affect. If she reacts that's ""weakness"" and proof that she as a woman doesn't have the stones to lead. Jill Stein got Mitt Romney elected governor in Massachusetts. Anybody who was all in for Jill Stein is someone who does NOT ""do their research"". We get fucked as a country and you laugh your ass off. Yeah that works. Right on. You have it all figured out. Must be a hermit crab. Fuckin Russia played us like fools.You are saying voting in an election is to be ""played like fools"". It is nothing short of amazing. You are the ones being played right here and now and it's just such a sad sad display. question as with all these things: did she actively coordinate with them? Didn't she make a trip over there? You don't have to bring someone into your confidence to get in their head. I've watched it happen. I called that from day one. Maybe not that Russia was involved but it was obvious she was just there to take votes from Hillary. This is me being surprised. She was a plant and I think Pelosi & co should look into stein’s campaign. She rarely criticized trump but enjoyed trashing Clinton making sure her supporters stayed home rather than vote for Hillary Stein ran in the last election too. Are you suggesting that the Green Party is some conservative conspiracy to divide liberals? Are you suggesting that the Green Party is some conservative conspiracy to divide liberals?Why did conservatives donate to the Green Party if not to divide liberals?Such a strategy is very legal and very cool.

Not just the myriad of facts but the actual confirmation of crimes commited. Thats whats really scary about it a GOP politician or laywer or whatever can be convicted of campaign finance fraud embezzlement pedophelia whatever and a large portion of the country go on supporting these people regardless. the same way the GOP ran the 2016 election cycle under the premise that feelings were more important than facts which Newt Gingrich flat faced admitted in a CNN interview.Seeing Newt say this was the first time in a while my jaw actually dropped in reaction to some political event. That was the moment I started feeling like I was on crazy pills. I wish I had a link to that Viola.https://youtu.be/xnhJWusyj4I Thank you that dude is such a fucking weasel And that's a fact not just a feeling. Here you go. Thanks! I'm confused. Dershowitz isn't Trump's lawyer. He comments don't help the law they harm his own reputation and I  don't even see how they help Trump.BTW the GOP argument failed badly in the midterms. Helping Trump helps him maybe get a pardon for raping a trafficked minor at Epstein's mansion. I don't even see how they help Trump.The phrase [Big Lie] was also used in a report prepared during the war by the United States Office of Strategic Services in describing Hitler's psychological profile:[5][6]His primary rules were: never allow the public to cool off; never admit a fault or wrong; never concede that there may be some good in your enemy; never leave room for alternatives; never accept blame; concentrate on one enemy at a time and blame him for everything that goes wrong; people will believe a big lie sooner than a little one; and if you repeat it frequently enough people will sooner or later believe it.[7][8]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie I understand the idea. I'm talking out the actual situation today. Trump has three risks: 2020 Mueller impeachment. Dershowitz had to know that his distortion does not help with Mueller. I don't see how it helps with the opener issues. Furthermore you are saying that Dershowitz is now just a front for Trump.,0,False,t3_a7bq08,49,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/a7bq08/alan_dershowitz_roasted_after_telling_fox_news/,563,,Alan Dershowitz Roasted After Telling Fox News ‘Lying to the FBI is Not a Crime’,563,https://lawandcrime.com/awkward/alan-dershowitz-roasted-after-telling-fox-news-lying-to-the-fbi-is-not-a-crime/

EyeOfTheBeast,"Doesn't it just need a comma? It is the automatic title made when the link is posted.  I didn't check it . . . . :/ Yes it is the awful result of clicking post after the auto-title function filled the  title space but before I checked it. As far as I've heard not a single federal lawmaker has uttered the word ""treason"" in connection to Trump in the past two years of his brazenly committing it on a daily basis.Our politics is so far through the looking glass that the looking glass is already long over the horizon in the rearview mirror. They haven't uttered treason because Trump hasn't commited it  based on the very narrow definition of what treason is. In order for his actions with Russia to be considered treason we would need to be in declared or open warfare with Russia which we are not. If we were to charge Trump with treason it's basically telling Russia we are at war with them not something anybody really wants. Allowing a foreign government to influence domestic power and tamper with election results isn't treason? I know it feels like treason but legally it's not. It is. Interfering with another country's election is an act of war. Congress doesn't have to declare war for a state of war to exist. You can say that all you want but that doesn't make it true. 🤷‍♂️ You're one of those fools that would move the goalposts out so far on treason to make the statue entirely meaningless.  Russia could set off a nuclear bomb in NYC and you'd have the audacity to claim that since Congress hadn't declared war supporting them isn't treason. So piss off and go back to /r/republicans trumpster. Well that would be open warfare so it would be different and constitue treason then. It's not my fault that the legal definition of treason is so narrow. that's just how it is. The legal definition is not narrow:Whoever owing allegiance to the United States levies war against them or adheres to their enemies giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere is guilty of treason and shall suffer death or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.Adhering to enemies alone qualifies as treason. We need not be at war. Thing is Russia is not legally considered an enemy of the United States so it is legally impossible for Trump to commit treason with them. Here is a Washington Post article talking about it. You seem to be confusing the statements ""Legally it's not treason"" and ""Trump did nothing wrong"". Not saying crimes weren't committed treason just wasn't one of them. It’s not an act of war per se but the US Code with regard to treason is pretty clear here:Whoever owing allegiance to the United States levies war against them or adheres to their enemies giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere is guilty of treason and shall suffer death or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.Adhering to enemies alone qualifies. You're missing the part were they define what an enemy is. Russia is not legally an enemy of the United States we're currently at ""peace"" with them. That presumes that ""enemy"" means an active conflict. Or an open declaration of war. Technically we didn't declare war on a lot of countries in the 20th century.To the best of my knowledge we haven't tested that in a 21st century context. Wow you're dense. The definition of enemy doesn't change because we are at the most peaceful time in human history. OK.Define an enemy of the state in a way that includes all non-state actors. Enemy is not well-defined in an era when the last open declaration of war against a state actor was almost 80 years ago.Also was the USSR an enemy of the US even though we never explicitly declared war beyond tensions? He uses his time at the microphone to excoriate the Republicans and Fox News when a Fox reporter asked a question.Damn good appearancelet's  spread it around.Our in-love-with-Trump News gang aren't going to make it a feature.

He's not only unqualified but he's almost psychotic.Republicans need to wake up to the fact that they are enabling trumps mental illness by still supporting him.  They would do trump a favor by impeaching him which will make trump resign. And Presidents aren't supposed to interfere with investigations and be criminals.   I'd argue that's the bigger issue.Comey helped the Democrats by announcing the investigation is open into Hillary's emails' days before the election huh.

KubrickIsMyCopilot,"Let me preface this comment by saying first that I am a veteran.That being said... I’ve seen the unsavory cult of the soldier as a civilian and in uniform. Tolstoy opened my eyes up to this in his book “the kingdom of god is within you” when he discusses the military. Nations with separation of church and state must essentially create a religion. This religion being patriotism. And honestly think about it when a soldier dies we do make them martyrs.But even within the military that cult of the soldier is dangerous. Of course any organization that will ask you to kill in their name has to indoctrinate their soldiers that they are somehow superior to the general population. But what actually indoctrinates these young people is the attention they receive from the civilian population.On a lighter note this reminds me of this clip from curb your enthusiasmhttps://youtu.be/LPquarz16wQ This really irks a buddy of mine who is in the AF. He hates people treating him differently (even though it's good treatment) just cause he is military. But then it REALLY burns him up when he hears or sees a military member making a big deal somewhere. The ""Well I'm a Vet so you should do this for me even though it's not allowed"" kinda thing. I do agree that all the attention can easily go to someones head and think they are better than everyone else...like my room mate. Give him a few drinks and any type of argument with someone and it's immediately ""Well your just a civilian"" etc.I used to work retail would vent in a group chat with a group of friends he was part of. Being so close to a base made that experience extremely common. And don't get me started on the spouses...... Oh yea man it’s all an indoctrination and when you’re 19 and the person who’s telling you this is offering you the biggest paycheck I had ever received feeding you three times a day etc it’s easy to fall into it or at the very least believe that this is an organization that will literally die to protect you.And I totally understand it man I have an acquaintance that will immediately ask someone if they are a veteran when debating world politics because if they aren’t he won’t listenOh boy mil spouses+retail+proximity to base= lots of petty shoplifting and “can I speak to your manager” and “uh oh yea I get a military discount” I’m sure Honestly we asked about mil discount as part of our sales pitch (Verizon Wireless Corporate store). We were paid well and being by base as gravy. One of their first stops.But it was afterwards. The broken phones the bill overages the ""my husband deployed and never added me to the account as a manager and I want a new iPhone""'s. Sorry mam my job is way more important than you needing a pink iphone.It usually was ""My husband is a (insert any NCO rank) and you better make this right""  Honestly the lowly airmen and the actual officers were very nice but the officers spouses could be a bit difficult as well but they weren't much different than the rich women who walked in. They threw money at us instead of rank...usually... Airmen probably hadn't drank the koolaid yet. We made a lot of special accommodations for people but when they started with that BS it didn't go far. It's due to the culture of every and any nation to make to they fallen soldiers into Marty's this trend as happened in ancient Rome up to now. The reason for this is the fact if a nation does exist than there be a certain level of Nationalism and this is what causes this behavior towards fallen soldiers.",0,False,t3_a7gtjo,5,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/a7gtjo/a_surreal_conversation_about_public_displays_of/,7,"Throughout this area up and down all the major streets there are permanent banners celebrating the military and locals who are in it.  Not people who died or *did* anything in particular just people who happen to be in inform.  

Those displays have been there for years and similar displays in other facets of local life have just been becoming more and more prevalent while basically no other profession sees anything like that kind of public adulation.

Finally I got irritated recently with something another person was saying on the subject and expressed my long-held thoughts about it.  The result was a surreal dive into a rabbit hole of authoritarianism and brainwashing.

This is paraphrased but captures the gist:

&gt; X: They deserve our respect and appreciation for their service.

Me: Do you feel the same way about teachers?

&gt; X: Absolutely.

Me: Where are the banners for the teachers?  

&gt; X: I'm sure they're in lots of places.

Me: Well these banners for the military are *everywhere* around here.  

&gt; X: We don't want to leave anyone out and they deserve a lot of respect for their service and sacrifice.

Me: Do nurses deserve a lot of respect for their service and sacrifice?

&gt; X: Of course lots of people do.  This isn't about that.

Me: *Why* isn't it about that?  Why is every major street in this area covered in praise of the military while every other form of service is treated like it doesn't exist?

&gt; X: Nothing stops you from putting up a display for teachers or anyone else.  Are you going to?

Me: It does *so* stop me from doing that - it's public property that needs approval from the city.  And those military displays aren't some private citizen group's spontaneous act of generosity they're taxpayer-funded and part of a nationwide propaganda campaign that's been going on since 2003.

&gt; X: Our brave men and women in uniform deserve our respect for their service and sacrifice.

(*At this point I felt a chill at the robotic way the guy recited this phrase from memory*)

Me: If I went to the city council and proposed replacing half of those military displays with celebrations of local teachers firefighters nurses doctors or whatever would you support it?

&gt; X: Why would we have to disrespect the troops to respect anyone else?

Me: Wait so having *fewer* taxpayer-funded displays all over the city celebrating the military would be ""disrespectful"" to them?  They're *entitled* to being praised everywhere all the time?

&gt; X: They deserve all the respect we can give them.

Me: But it's not disrespectful of teachers nurses scientists etc. to have *no* significant displays honoring them?  Fewer displays for soldiers is ""disrespect"" but no displays at all for anyone else is *not* disrespect?

&gt; X: The service and sacrifice of the troops deserve all the appreciation we can give them.  If you want to honor someone else no one's stopping you.

Me: But they *are* stopping me.  I just told you that.  It's public property and they don't want to ""distract"" from the military displays by putting up other things.

&gt; X: Why are you so angry about this?  Don't you think our Brave Troops Deserve to Be Honored for Their Service and Sacrifice? 

It just went downhill from there.  I lost count of the number of times the terms ""service"" or ""sacrifice"" were used as a thought-terminating cliche to deflect from some painful contradiction they were caught in.

loveskoalas,"Always complaining about how taxes are spent and what programs to cut all the while scheming to pay as little as possible. Republicans elected a billionaire that is appointing other billionaires to fix the system that made them billionaires?I guess republicans still believe in ‘trickle down’? “The ‘trickle-down’ theory; the principle that the poor who must subsist on table scraps dropped by the rich can best be served by giving the rich bigger meals.” William Blumhttp://billmoyers.com/story/now-just-five-men-almost-much-wealth-half-worlds-population/https://www.rt.com/usa/412483-one-percent-wealth-gap/“The great irony of [republican] Americans electing a “businessman” who couldn’t get a loan from a U.S. bank.  Nor could his son-in-law or campaign manager” (Amy Siskand) elected a billionaireBarely even a hundred millionaire if that. IRS may be ‘gutted’ but they still have plenty of people to go after middle and lower middle class folk for $1k / $2k mistakes that severely impact families. These types of graphs seem to look at the numbers the wrong way that is not proportioned on % of original tax burden. It appears initially like it should be 20% for each bucket or maybe even weighted on the left since that’s where the people who need the most help are. However the bottom 20% probably couldn’t get 20% of the tax break unless we actually paid them since they don’t have to pay much in taxes to begin with.So to anyone who has already done the research could you please describe how these numbers shake out when measured in proportion to tax burden? Skull & Bones. The top 20% pays more than 70% of all income taxes so 65% of the tax cuts going to them is actually under representing what they should get if everything was going to be ""fair"" The top 20% would not be in the top 20% if they were anywhere else on the planet. They already pay a smaller proportion than the vast majority of Americans.The US tax system is unfair because the wealthy do not pay their fair share.Republicans have gutted the IRS to make it easier for the wealthy to avoid paying taxes. The IRS and the FBI should get a much bigger budget to make it easier to make all those wealthy unpatriotic tax cheats contribute to society. I like this post because it can start a lot of good conversations about where tax burden belongs in this country so I’m curious how do you measure “fair share”? The fair share is what made this country after WWII. The US did massive infrastructure and educational investment that made it the wealthiest and most powerful nation on earth.We currently have historically low tax rates for the wealthy and some states can’t even fund their schools or fix their bridges.Wealthy people are not paying into the system that made them wealthy. Essentially making it impossible for everyone else to get the same opportunities that made them wealthy.Sacrifice seems to be something for the poor while the wealthy can get away with anything in America. This is the country where affluenza is taken seriously by a judge. This is the country where Jeffrey Epstein (a serial child rapist that most likely took advantage of 50+ underage girls) got a little slap on the wrist by a Republican prosecutor. SO. WHAT.The point of progressive taxation is the underlying notion than the last $10 is less valuable to the individual than the first $10.That the richest people whose last millions are less valuable to them than the first few millions pay the most in taxes isn't even an interesting talking point. So what? Well the point is that it is hard to give tax cuts to people who barely pay any taxes when the bottom 20% pays like 1% of the taxes how much can you cut? You... don't cut taxes?We're at historically low tax rates already. Why would we cut taxes any further? What's the point of cutting taxes for the richest then? Well now you are just changing topics completely. First you complain about the cuts going to the people who pay taxes now you just say there shouldn't but any cuts. If you think there shouldn't be any cuts there are plenty of good arguments that could support that. It’s not like the middle class doesn’t pay taxes either. Or the top quartile.There are lots of places to cut taxes that aren’t the precious 1%.In fact you could cut taxes from the second and third quartile of taxpayers and effectively achieve the same net effect: http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/10/06/a-closer-look-at-who-does-and-doesnt-pay-u-s-income-tax/And those folks will benefit the most from the breaks. That’s what bothers me about how these numbers are displayed. If we want to talk about 70% of the tax burden getting 65% of the benefit being to much that’s a fair and constructive discussion but the way this data is presented initially leads the reader to think it should be an even 20% per group or even weighted favorably toward the left. However I wonder how much more benefit the bottom 20% could get even if we cut all their taxes as very few have to pay taxes as it is at that income level.",0,False,t3_a70hoc,17,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/a70hoc/cut_and_gut_how_republicans_helped_the_rich_raid/,367,,Cut and gut: How Republicans helped the rich raid the U.S. Treasury,367,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/12/16/1818852/-Cut-and-gut-How-Republicans-helped-the-rich-raid-the-U-S-Treasury

I expect to be called an idiot for pursuing the individual liberties afforded to us in America in the politics sub but not the liberal one.The people empowered with pursuing justice in our system are trusted to chase down the crime and pursue those that committed it not to chase down those they disagree with to find the crime.The point is that they shouldn’t be rooting around in individuals matters looking for criminality the fact that the find it under suspect circumstances itself used to hurt the prosecution.But I am an idiot and you are wise so I guess I am totally off base pursuing the liberal ideals our country was founded on. I get what you're trying to say but you seem to be willfully ignoring the mountain of context and existing evidence of criminality both concrete and circumstantial and you seem happy to suggest the President of the United States is ""just another individual""Tell me honestly - how did you feel about the Whitewater probe and the way it was conducted? How about the Benghazi investigations? Or the endless investigations into Hillary's emails? Were they all totally legit and completely not a made-up political witchhunt? I'm sure what they found in the Cohen sweep is what us fueling this not to mention the recordings of conversations he had. He has a history of this behavior how can they not? ""So I guess we can just dig and dig into Trump until we find evidence worthy of prosecution.""Just like Hillary. If he's innocent like Hillary he will be exonerated like Hillary. The solution: we elect a president who hasn’t engaged in unethical activity or committed crimes? The reason they’re saying these things is because so many people - and Trump himself - have implicated themselves publicly on multiple occasions. Hell the only reason we even have the Mueller investigation is because Trump said in public that he fired Rosenstein because of the Russia probe. I really love how so many people react to these types of things saying essentially “B-b-but Hillary is the devil!” She has absolutely nothing to do with the crimes of Donald Trump. And he deserves to be investigated thoroughly for his crimes just as Clinton was investigated. Inestigating based on probable cause is fundamental to the rule of law. We passed probable cause a long time ago.Commiting crimes to gain power demonizing enemies and immigrants calling for violence speaking nothing but lies and propoganda - THAT is what dictators do. Deutsche bank is known to be a vessel for money laundering. Trump has ties with them and a good amount of circumstantial evidence suggesting there was something fucky with his campaign finances and inauguration. What’s not to understand here? There’s perfectly reasonable grounds to investigate. It’s “never-ending” because of GOP obstruction. Your talking backwardsWhy is this a “threat” ?In order for this to be prompted you have to concede trump is the one who rejected transparency in the first place then proceeded to lie several times since his refusal to do so It is a threat because Schiff is simply looking for anything he can find and is willing to walk through the President’s entire financial history and engagements to do it.Stalin’s deputy premier is quoted with saying “show me the man and I will show you the crime” because their ‘investigations’ started with the target also. And I can’t believe I have to explain this but Stalin’s USSR was the opposite of liberal. They killed liberals. Schiff is taking a Stalinist approach to the President and that is the threat of it all. Again...trump refused to release them when every president before him has he had lied several times about why it couldn’t be released.The act of releasing them isn’t terribleThe only threat comes from what they might find ..and that would somehow be anyone’s fault but trumps? Lol You have a long way to go before you convince anyone of the bs your trying to peddle here bro...Go Home and work on it lol I don’t need to work on it because it is the established practice in our country. Saying someone shouldn’t fear investigation because they shouldn’t have done anything wrong is backwards and Stalinist.I don’t mind not convincing you because you clearly are not a liberal why even waste time in a sub based on the liberal ideas if you disagree? Refusing historic transparency having questionable sources of funding for condos and casinos and publically deriding your investigators means you need your shit checked out. It's the President. Not some random person. The leader of the country. They need to be clean. Nothing to hide nothing to fear though right? And don't you want to make sure the President is trustworthy?",0,False,t3_a6g4ye,39,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/a6g4ye/schiff_plans_to_obtain_deutsche_bank_records_of/,414,,Schiff plans to obtain Deutsche Bank records of Trump's personal finances,414,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/421461-schiff-plans-to-obtain-deutsche-bank-records-of-trumps-personal-finances
EyeOfTheBeast,"How there hasn’t been a revolt against Trump in the party that sells itself on morality family values and Christianity is beyond me.It is truly the party of debauchery. Hypocrites the lot of them. There is one of those mega churches in the largest town near me maybe I should visit some Sunday and listen to what is being said.  I say those right wingers did more damage to Christianity than the Islamic terrorists. Y'all Qaeda isn't just a running joke... Christianity has always been this way by its very design. Morality doesn’t mean universal values to them .. it means subjugation to MY gods will Because it would mean they were wrong.Being wrong about a Game of Thrones prediction or a football bet is like a $100 loss at most and a few jokes for a few weeks.Being wrong about who you put up for the president of a fucking country? You'd never hear the end of it.Just think Ben and Ice Town but way way worse. r/unexpectedPandR I mean it’s pretty simple...abortion is a huge reason...but other than that it is blatant racism. People honestly believe this is a Christian country...it isn’t...it was specifically founded by people wanting freedom of religion. The GOP uses scare tactics against essentially the lowest IQ individuals in our country and this is the result. I’m not saying Republican politicians are low IQ they’re actually geniuses...they’re just evil. They give no fucks that the majority of America actually doesn’t want them in power. The only saving grace is the upcoming seemingly progressive generations and the dying off of insanely backwards generations. The Republican party today is at it’s last stand and they know it. They will soon be forced to adapt or die It's hyperbole to suggest that Republican politicians are geniuses but otherwise I agree with you And I agree with you completely Individually there are some dumb motherfuckers in the republican party but as a whole their plan to squeeze all the money out of the lower class already succeeded. Yes and ironically it's the lowest of the lower classes that still have so much support for the GOP and especially trump He still has an 80-90% approval rating among Republican voters that's why. And you can largely thank the Fox News/Breitbart/Sinclair propaganda machine for that. I hear you and am aware. But I still find it mind numbing. I’ll never again going to be able to look at a republican and take them seriously. Fuck the lot of them. POS Another one of Trump's ""best people."" Best coffee boy.

Doctheengineer,“He will never be my president because he doesn’t read books can’t write more than a sentence or two at a time has no loyalties beyond himself is more insular than any New Yorker I ever knew and because I don’t see anything admirable or honorable about him.”  (Garrison Keillor) He displays many signs of a learning disability. He’s probably spent his whole life trying to compensate for having something like dyslexia. His bullying personality goes hand in hand with the insecurities he clearly has. What signs? • Low attention span.• Inability to read a script or intelligence briefings or a teleprompter.• His stunted and bizarrely child-like speech patterns compared to his speech patterns from several years ago.• Impulsiveness.• Issues with regulating his emotions namely his temper.• Compulsive lying.You think the way he acts is normal? Seriously? This is a better list of evidence for age-related diseases than learning disability. Which learning disability is that? Ask your mom. I don't have a learning disability though why are you making fun of me That’s a totally standard damage clause... Wow! Thank you for sharing that YouTube video. We need to pressure the shit out of republican senators to do the right thing.  They are the key to getting trump impeached. I'd rather not have him impeached since the vice president is even worse than him but they're both bad Can you name one with any ethics? Abraham Lincoln Damn didn’t know he was alive Republicans seem to think he's be leading the Republican Party if he was alive. Bahahaah. Remember that time Mitch McConnell filibustered his own bill?Good times. . .Good times. . . I think he needs glasses but doesnt want to wear them because he doesnt like how they look XD Read the whole article. I think it's satire with a gossamer wrapping of truth around it. Many articles from the Root are like this. Not necessarily intended to be taken 100% literally. Well the writer gave 6 points and one of them have 8 evidences. And I really love the 6th point he gave. When did liberals start caring about constitutional rights lol especially the first 2. I don't know that this is one I can buy into. Point 4 is nearly pure satire and doesn't supply evidence to its claim. While Donald Trump could very well be a white supremacist I can't explicitly say he is so I wouldn't be writing about it while informing people. Trump's gained support in a variety of unethical ways but I'll do my best to steer clear of bias and conclusions. For the sake of my party. While Donald Trump could very well be a white supremacist I can't explicitly say he isWhat would it take for you to say someone is a white supremacist? Not Trump in particular but anyone. If Fox News told him to say it. Implying that one race is inferior to the other or deserves less. And what would imply that in your mind? Would a person have to explicitly say words to that effect? For me to write about them yes. Otherwise no. Well that’s the key disagreement I think. Why do you think a person’s actions can’t tell us about their values? There are ways to be racist without using racial slurs - in fact they’re much more common. You could correctly assume somebody is racist by the expression on their face when talking to a black person. It could be clear as day just not explicitly expressed. However you can't attribute their beliefs to their behaviors with 100% certainty so I feel you can't label them a racist in your article title. I think the media should provide raw input and the public can interpret it how they'd like. What’s the difference between a person with racist beliefs who acts upon them and a person without racist beliefs who still does racist things? How are they meaningfully different? So... there should be no opinion or satire peices?You're coming off as a bit silly here and taking this WAAAYYYYY too seriously almost to the point of unbelevability.

TheJames02,No one can speak for all Democrats. That said gun control is a matter of drawing a line. You can have this but not that. I own several guns but I am open to a compromise. Where would you draw the line? I would be ok with background checks and record keeping every time a gun changes hands. As it is now there are checks and record keeping when you go to a store but I can buy a gun from an individual and nothing is done. We do it with cars. Why not guns? I could also live with a limit on magazine capacity. But that's just me. The background checks are jokes. And no checks for many kinds of weapons. The budget for the agency is a joke.Ammunition also needs more oversight. Plenty of room for controls. In any even the 4th amendment has been bastardized to support pro gun groups. And that’s a recent  development in history. Gun ownership should be a privilege not a right. Abuse of guns have become an epidemic in our nation and the whole concept of gun ownership as a right needs to be revisited. I'm willing to compromise but I'm in favor of anything that produces less injury and death from firearms. If that means compromise I'm fine with that. If that means banning guns outright I'm fine with that too.If you want to avoid the latter option then rein in organizations like the NRA that have spent decades lobbying against any kind of gun control at all. Thanks for answering. To my knowledge the NRA has been pretty open to compromises. They recently said they support banning bump stocks. To my knowledge the NRA has been pretty open to compromises.Then today is the day you learn what the NRA has been doing on your behalf:https://www.wbur.org/npr/556578593/the-nra-wasnt-always-against-gun-restrictionshttps://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/09/nra-opposes-outright-us-ban-on-gun-devices-used-by-las-vegas-killer.htmlhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/03/14/how-the-nra-has-shaped-the-worlds-gun-laws/I grant you the NRA has made noises about moderating their stance in recent months. I think that has a lot to do with their impending bankruptcy. But for the past few decades they've done their best to paint any gun control as a slippery slope to banning all guns. I think their reasoning for opposing gun control is based on the gun bans in England and Australia. They're scared it will happen here. Too bad. They don’t run the country. And you’ve not engaged in any rational discussion so I dub you Troll I don't think think should. We need to have background checks where ever it's possible. They're a little too extreme for me. If you don't want it to happen here then stop getting in the way of less restrictive methods of curbing gun violence. England and Australia banned guns because they were becoming a problem. We're not willing to admit they're a problem here. We've had semi-automatic and even fully automatic guns available to the public for almost 100 years now. I think the problem lies somewhere else. Also lets not forget that violent crime rates have spiked after countries imposed gun bans. https://crimeresearch.org/2016/04/murder-and-homicide-rates-before-and-after-gun-bans/ And now they have knife and acid attacks. So how exactly did banning guns help? When was the last acid or knife attack that killed dozens and hurt hundreds?https://www.upi.com/59-dead-hundreds-hurt-at-Vegas-concert-in-deadliest-mass-shooting-in-US/1061506934022/How many of them were seriously hurt accidentally from knife or acid?https://www.aftermath.com/content/accidental-shooting-deaths-statisticsJust because they haven't completely solved the problem of violence doesn't mean they haven't made significant gains in reducing the harm caused by a single person. I want to take guns away from people that shouldn’t have guns. So people with criminal records? Yes. People that have children in the home that aren’t responsible with them like people that keep a loaded gun anywhere near a child people with a history of suicidal or homicidal thoughts and other people I can’t think of right now. I think people with a history of mental health problems should have to go through some kind of test and have a psychologist sign that its safe for them to own a gun. I have problem with the first one though. What constitutes an irresponsible gun owner and would people with children not be allowed to own guns? I agree. I think someone that had treatment for suicidal thoughts 25 years ago and been fine since shouldn’t have a problem buying a gun but people with recent suicide attempts or has ever been homicidal shouldn’t be allowed to have guns. I don’t think people with children shouldn’t be allowed to have guns. I think it should be illegal to have a loaded gun around a child and if caught they should have their guns confiscated. Children have died from getting ahold of their parents loaded gun and that is completely unacceptable to me. I don't mean to troll. I'm just asking a question I don't know the answer to. I'm sorry if I offended you in any way. Why should I be ashamed? Also if it's a stupid question then could you answer it? Nevermind I'll just wait for someone else to answer.

I get your point but can you really get life for cocaine? 3 strikes and you're out!!!Thanks Clinton.... Selling yeah probably I think you’re wrong I can’t find any evidence of non-violent frog offenses resulting in life sentences. Took me about 5 seconds to find an example.https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2015/07/15/from-a-first-arrest-to-a-life-sentence/?utm_term=.750ccf9bc0cb It probably depends on the state but enough volume I could see a life sentence. Maybe not cocaine but definitely heroin. I’m just weighing a thought I’d have to research moreEdit: Also don’t agree with it. Throw that in there https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2015/07/15/from-a-first-arrest-to-a-life-sentence/?utm_term=.750ccf9bc0cb They usually tack on a bunch of manslaughter charges and the judge hands down sentences sequentially instead of simultaneously - effectively resulting in a life sentence.It's rare but not unheard of it they are a 'big dealer'. This isn't handed down to the guy on the street corner but to the supplier of the guys on the corner. YUP I really really hope so. Not till he leaves office at the end of his term and will most likely resign first and get a full pardon by Pence. Pence might get indicted too That would be beautiful. Next in line would be speaker of the house? Yeah could you image all this shit happens and they're both removed and Nancy Pilosi takes over? That would be great That would be hilarious tbh. The president can’t be charged with a crime while in office. This isn’t a precursor for anything because Democrats aren’t going to risk it all to impeach him and impeaching him is the only way to indict him. I fully expect him to be impeached by the house at this point. It’s almost a certainty. But it won’t get past the senate to remove him. Same thing that happened to Johnson and Clinton. I’m merely pointing to the backlash republicans faced after the attempted impeachment of Clinton. If we are playing the long game it’s much easier to beat him in 2020 if we keep working then to face backlash from impeachment. Just my opinion though. I get what you're saying and I don't necessarily disagree with you. I just don't like it lol. These last two years have been detrimental to the United States. From pulling out of NAFTA and the Paris Climate Agreement to our last speech with NATO all this administration is doing is showing that they don't care about anybody else but us. This ""America First"" rhetoric is really damaging our image in the rest of the world and its going to take a long time to fix.All that said we're only half way through his tenure. Two more years of this is terrifying to think about. There is uncertainty about the inability to indict a sitting President. It is more of a policy than a law. It is unlikely a Republican-run DOJ would change it but it could be open to a court challenge.Of course we still don’t know the actual crimes Trump has committed. Campaign finance infractions would probably not persuade a Republican Senate to convict. More egregious conspiracy with Russians may be enough. However Trump’s lack of emails will protect him. He will blame everyone around him and never admit guilt. I don’t see why there would be plea deals if they didn’t implicate trump. In court SC had to prove to a judge that Trump is implicated and that the SC provided evidence. The SC also is now compelled to indict trump. A plea deal is a serious thing. well he is a non indicted co-conspirator.. depends on the democrats and impeachment.

JackFisherBooks,"It's not just us it's the world.  I've pondered this question over the last couple years and I believe it is the natural predator if it species.We're living in a society of mass data input and most are not well suited to digest the data and extract the right information so we gravitate towards whatever information stokes the most powerful emotions. Unfortunately there most powerful emotions are going to be negative: anger envy hate fear etc. and we're reacting to those emotions.I believe the combination of: false social media realities (what people advertise their own lives to look like online) mass consumer expectations and income inequality are playing the largest roles in the mass unhappiness if societies around the world: we're being told by different sources that others are happier & have more/better things yet the harder effort we put into obtaining these false lives/lifestyles the further away they get.This is really the beginning stages of our natural self destruction and I'm going to be sure to tell my kids: don't reproduce (as much as I'd love grandchildren) and be selfish with your life.  It's pessimistic but probably realistic as well: today's children will be the last big generation that doesn't suffer. After this there will be the few who can afford to not suffer and the rest of the human population will be a dying mass.  But have a great week lol. Not having kids isn't ""being selfish with your life"" it's probably the single most selfless altruistic and significant thing anyone can do to leave the world slightly better than we found it. One answer is Fox News regularly tells its viewers to be angry about something.That's like 40% of the population in a constant state of fear and anger.Then you have the angry Facebook meme factories and the long work hours no paid holiday and no guaranteed healthcare.You've got a recipe for angry cynical folks. One answer is Fox News regularly tells its viewers to be angry about something.Ahahahaha no.  Fox News is hardly the one that pushes the outrage police.  Unless its simply because you disagree with what they say then that's on you. ""War on Christmas"" ""immigrant caravan changing white man's america!"" ""They want to take your guns and put you in a camp!""Lol... sure buddy. I bet youre more pissed than all the liberals put together and about shit that literally has never and will never ever have a single cent or breath of impact on your life or anyone you know or their children. Why so angry? Little secret. The most ANGRY people ask that on reddit. I'm not angry.  But your post before this just kind of confirms something....You're not interested in a discussion you're just interested in arguing and one upping someone on the internet.You do you babe. You're right. I'm not interested in ""discussion"" with trolls.And yes my posts do 100 percent confirm that.Now... as I've been honest with you maybe you can be honest with me. Why should anyone have a conversation with someone who is only intent on lies and rereception. Repeating shity talking points that they know they are more guilty of and they love that they revel.in their irrational hatred.Why would anyone placate such a person? Why should anyone have a conversation with someone who is only intent on lies and rereception. Repeating shitry tlaking points that they know they are more guilty of and they love that they revel.in their irrational hatred.Why would anyone placate such a person?Because both sides come from a point of view that the other is the one that is lying or deceiving.  Because in the end the only way to a middle ground with someone that has opposing views as the proverbial you is to talk.  Not shout.  Not one up.  That's not a discussion.The proverbial me doesn't have to agree with everything the proverbial you believes or says.  A world where everyone agrees on everything is a scary place to be IMHO.  It's the reason we don't have and don't want monarchies as a 'government'.  One needs the other to keep each other in check.  My views are informed from a lot of different sources.  Some of its plain old history.  Hard proven science.  Some is CNN.  Some is Fox.  Some is T_D.  Some is /liberal.  Some is /conservative.  Some is /libertarian.  Tend to ignore twitter but whatever.  Point is there is no 100 percent right vs 100 percent wrong.We don't have to agree.  It is more than ok to disagree.We just have to be civil.  If one (or both?) can't do that then there is no need in having a discussion.  Because it gets no where.  One could be 100 percent right but the other won't see it because their perception (reception?) is being clouded by the manner in which the information is presented. ""Ahahaha no fox news is hardly the one that pushes the outrage police"".Your first words were laughing at us.Mocking us for having a different opinion.Why do you PRETEND that you come in a the exact opposite way in which you do?Why do you come full of hate and then talk about tolerance when people react as you WANT?That... is what angers me. WILLFUL HYPOCRICY.You only want divide and lie every word you speak claiming you want discussion.You want to lie and you want to promote lies and you want us to be civil while you do because you want to destroy... everything.You've not said ONE CIVIL WORD THAT WOULD ENCOUREAGE DISCUSSION. Both sides are the same - the rationale of the ignorant. I don't think that's true.  I think its an easy way out.The extremes are definitely insane....Which is to say the 5 percent of the whole to the far left 5 percent of the whole to the far right.  They are definitely the same.The middle 90 percent of all Republicans and Democrats all lumped together are all pretty reasonable.Romney got obliterated by the media in the secret recording of him saying something like (heavily paraphrased) ""45 percent will always vote Democrat.  45 percent will always vote Republican.  we can't worry about them.

It would be kismet beyond comprehension to see that orange spray tan fuck spend the rest of his life in jail... They didn't dump him when they thought they could lose all three branches of government in 2016.

They need to wear trump like an anchor This is exactly right.Trump has an 80% approval rating among Republicans. The Republicans are Trump. They have someone in office that won’t veto. That is al they care about. I like how they are thinking of not supporting him to save the party not because it is the right thing to do to save the country.  They are also not going to do a damn thing it is clear they are more afraid of losing the Trump voting base than they are of normalizing corruption. If the last two years haven't made you realize that Republicanss don't give a flying fuck about the hoi polloi or the future you are beyond hope.All they care about is money and power.The rest of us be damned.And to anyone who still supports Trump after his demonstrating to everyone who can add single digits together and get the right answer and still support him; shame on you.

progress18,"Aren’t these comments by Comey premature and potentially harmful to Mueller’s findings? It doesn’t seem necessary for him to say anything and it only risks the appearances of bias by a witness in public. In public Comey’s comments only have the potential to hurt nothing he can say at this time can help. Just a reminder: Comey is not our friend or ally he deliberately and maliciously sabotaged Clinton's campaign because he is a lifelong Republican with a delusion grade hate on against the Clinton family and he is talking **ENTIRELY** about getting rid of Trump not getting rid of Trumpism or the rot in the Republican Party.TL;DR Fuck Comey. Agreed. Do we need to play the soundbite of him stating Saddam has WMD's? How did that turnout? This guy is no hero and we should stop pretending he is. Comey was convinced she had it in the bag and that if he didn't mention this her presidency would be ""illegitimate"" and I will remind you our legal savior Mueller is a republican. What are you talking about comey cleared the Clinton's multiple times.  The only reason he sent the letter he did was because the nypd got wieners laptop and he was forced into it.  They sat on it for 4 weeks before it got out I really don't think you're right about his motivations though I agree he's no particular friend or ally. He was in an impossible situation and I think he made the wrong call though he won't admit it presumably even to himself. I've also seen reporting that his hand was forced - that the NY FBI office was going to leak the existence of the investigation and he wanted to get out ahead of it and try to control the spin.Comey was a bad flawed FBI director but he's made it clear through both statement and action that he has no love for Trump. I can't see him intentionally putting Trump in the White House.he is talking ENTIRELY about getting rid of Trump not getting rid of Trumpism or the rot in the Republican Party.That's not true at all. There are two situations here I think people are conflating. The first is “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” It’s easy to assume that because Comey is attacking Trump there’s a draw to approve of or even ally with Comey.But I don’t think that’s what’s going on. Here’s the second situation: “When your enemy is in the process of destroying himself don’t intervene.” Comey a Republican is attacking the Republican president. Let him. Encourage that. Don’t encourage Comey across the board but let that spark grow to a flame. Allow your enemy to consume itself from within.

Bookscrounger,This is a HUGE problem. If an industry or company funds a study it should be bright lights at the top of the study I constantly harp on the fact that while liberals and conservatives argue the corporations are exploiting us; and in fact they encourage us to argue.It is much like Trump giving us so many big scandals that his day-to-day unethical policies and appointments slide by without comment. Multi-billion dollar multinational corporations fund the media on both sides. Controlled opposition and propaganda are powerful weapons against people who are struggling to tread water and always busy with work and family. If they can keep us at each other's throats they can get away exploiting our labor our resources and our government the same things they do in 3rd world nations. I’m a doc. Our journals used to be filled with multicenter studies funded by the NIH. Now it’s just the latest greatest device and/or drug at one or two institutions funded by the manufacturers. Guess what to everyone’s surprise it’s a favorable paper. Conferences are also filled with presenters sponsored by the manufacturers flown from conference to conference to give “education”.It’s getting tougher to get unbiased CME. Full-disclosure: I've interned/co-oped at a prominent medical device manufacturer and intend to work for them full-time.I think part of the issue is that the NIH and other unbiased institutions aren't willing to conduct as many studies (due to lack of funding) so the manufacturers are essentially forced to fund studies themselves (which puts undue pressure on the conductors of the studies to produce favorable results-even if there wasn't malintent).Also out of curiosity moreso. Do you really not find the education provided by device manufacturers to be useful and what would you like to be done differently? I know the company I worked for would frequently bring in doctors to teach them how to use the products or get feedback (depending on the production stage) and thought it seemed mutually beneficial (but I only saw it from one side).Edit: I may have creeped on your Reddit history and was surprised by how similar your interests are to mine. Keep on keeping on Why is the NIH underfunded? That’s the key question isn’t it?And let’s be honest the “education” provided by most device manufacturers is just veiled advertising to try to influence docs to use their stuff.Why don’t manufacturers give their education money to the NIH with no strings attached instead? Why is the NIH underfunded? That’s the key question isn’t it?Absolutely but I don't really have an answer. I think most (non-military) government research is underfunded and it's not really a NIH-specific problem. I know very few people who are happy with Congress' allocation of funds (no matter their ideology).And let’s be honest the “education” provided by most device manufacturers is just veiled advertising to try to influence docs to use their stuff.I mean sure. But I think it's also the best venue to teach physicians to use the devices-I don'tknow how else this could be done feasibly. (I can't comment on the same for pharma.)Why don’t manufacturers give their education money to the NIH with no strings attached instead?I could be totally wrong here but I think these are separate issues. I would support the money that is used to fund studies (and thus papers) going to the NIH and then they conduct the studies to (at least attempt) eliminate the bias. However I'm not sure if the NIH would be amenable to this. (I am also pretty unfamiliar with this process in general admittedly.) I'm working on a blog post about Vaxxers Anti-vaxxers pragmatists.My point is it isn't whether or not to give vaccines but rather which vaccines should we give which should we avoid and when? As an MD I find that the vaccine companies work very hard to make independent cost/benefit assessments all but impossible. Not too surprising I suppose. ProPublica is some of the best investigative journalism. They deserve support to continue. I hope people reading quality journalism like this will contribute when able. Color. Me. SHOCKED. I assume that's sarcasm... ? Yeah here's another venue - medicine that's been so taken over by special interests that although it appears forthright and well intended it is owned by and does the bidding of powerful pharmaceuticals and other pseudo-generous financial interests. Good point but I'm a doctor and I'm complicit.After hospital costs MDs are the biggest profiter from health dollars.But prescription drugs are gaining fast.AMA Info GASP Corruption in Healthcare....say it ain't so. There is NO MONEY in a cure. Big Pharma will just produce another wonder drug. Then another to combat the side effects of the first one. The two more to fix the damage done....and on and on it goes. Meanwhile they try to shut down anything that deals with natural healing. I mean you do have some companies working on cures— Gilead with Sovaldi and various companies working on new vaccines. Not saying that there aren't problems but what you're saying is essentially a conspiracy theory. Not just natural healing but any low-cost healing.25 years ago I had a pt with antihypertension Rxs well over $150/month... which he couldn't afford.
