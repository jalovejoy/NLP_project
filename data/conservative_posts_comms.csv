LumpyWumpus,"Top Minds are proud of themselves ""You're a hate sub!""uses ableist sexist homophobic languageTopminds everyone without a shred of self awareness. They represent a relatively large proportion of the lefty side. Reprehensible people. Toppest and tardest We're all making fun of you at top minds.How can one simply profess actively participating in such a toxic waste bin and retain any shred of self-respect? More importantly this person admits he’s brigading from top minds $ “You’re a racist piece of shit!”“How so?”“BIGOT HOMOPHOBE NAZI RACIST MISOGYNIST RADICAL ALT RIGHT WHITE SUPREMACIST -IST -PHOBE”-the Left literally any time disagreed with Hence...

The toppest of the top. Top. Minds. But they are definitely bottoms. You can tell by the huge stick up their ass Sheeeesh These are better than February's those were just pathetic.  Finally top tards are stepping up their game and showing us what kind compassionate coexisting loveable idiots they really are. I think the Mueller report made the leftists’ buttholes really sore these past few weeks and it shows. I waited to post this until today due to all the hoopla and fun times on April Fool's day.March brought us a good harvest of hate mail. We see homophobic slurs racial slurs someone insulting out penis sizes through 3 different accounts (I assume it was the same person) and even a doxxing threat. Good times were had by all. I gotta admit ""eat my fucking meatrod you shit kitten"" made me chuckle. You had the best response to one of them that had me LOL.  ""Neck yourself"" My favorites are the ones that say ""I didn't do anything against the rules!"" and then the mob just links their post where they say ""You should exist on the planet"" or ""Neck yourself.""  It's so cute how they try to pretend they're innocent like you can't just look at what was reported. Wow i wonder if the reddit admins will ban some of these people. Don't hold your breath.

Yosoff,"Up until now we've seen how the Constitution is like a ""deny all"" firewall rule strategy for the Federal Government.It starts out saying that the Federal Government has no powers whatsoever besides those specifically granted to it.  It then goes on to list those few powers that the Federal Government is allowed.Since the entire purpose of the Constitution is to define the structure and powers of the Federal Government there has been very little mention of the individual states.  Each state or commonwealth was expected to have its own Constitution to define its structure and powers.The 14th Amendment changes all of that.  This Amendment fundamentally transforms the Constitution.  It now controls the powers of the individual states in addition to the Federal Government.What's more when combined with the 9th Amendment (The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.) the Supreme Court can use the 14th Amendment to enforce any right imaginable and severely restrict the powers of the individual states.This was an enormous power grab for the Federal Government power which can be used for either good or evil.  People who love centralizing power in the Federal Government tend to see this is one of the greatest Amendments.  Ardent supporters of division of powers between local state and federal governments tend to like some clauses of this Amendment and despise other clauses.",0,False,t3_b8zstx,1,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b8zstx/us_constitution_discussion_week_39_of_52_14th/,4,"**Amendment XIV**

tehForce,"“If the narrative doesn’t fit you must acquit.” That is brilliant. I’m going to steal this one if you don’t mind it’s too funny to pass up. By all means. It belongs to all who appreciate its irony. Blessed are the ironists. Bless I will be sprinkling this like a good Parmesan. Lol. Gotta love a double standard. Have an upvote fine sir. I’d give you gold but I don’t like supporting reddit lol Incredibly unbelievable claims made against Kavanaugh with no proof evidence or reason to believe themThe left: this is very real and we must believe themClaims being made against a democrat who has a known history with pictures and video evidence of being a creepThe left: these are totally unbelievable.Now I'm not saying Biden is automatically guilty because that would be hypocritical of me. I need hard evidence to believe he actually did something not just pictures of him being a creep. But it's funny how the left will be super hypocritical on these two situations and not recognize their own hypocrisy. They are so blind and have absolutely no self reflection. I am saying he is guilty of being a creep to women and children. THERE IS VIDEO OF HIM BEING CREEPY. Imagine if the video depicted Trump doing the same thing The stuff with the kids is fucking disturbing honestly.  It's so much worse than a handsy old man getting too close with the wives of other politicians (though that's still not a great way to conduct yourself).  The kid stuff just looks predatory. I haven't seen these videos first hand but according to Ben Shapiro (who has) as well as some women on the right who have met Biden he definitely has a weird way of interacting with people but he doesn't seem to have any ulterior motive behind his actions. I'd personally believe that to be possible as my [very right-wing] uncle does the same thing. It's definitely a... different.. approach but an innocent one. If Biden is like my uncle he is literally just a very friendly person that can't withhold his appreciation for people.Obviously it's entirely possible Mr. Biden is guilty of sexual harassment but considering Ben Shapiro himself even believes these claims to be unlikely I can't help but be skeptical as well. YouTube search ""Creepy Joe Biden"" there's a video compilation spanning roughly 10 minutes of pure creepy cringe. It doesnt matter what political stripe you are there's no denying the creep factor. The issue with the creepy cringe videos are that like a lot of other videos they can be cut in a way that makes the instances way worse than they are. I know the left hates the ""it was a different time"" argument but societal norms have shifted dramatically and once accepted behavior is now deemed creepy. I do have a problem with the double standard of assuming guilt based on those behaviors for only half the aisle. The videos aren’t ambiguous.  They prove that he’s creepy and lacks self awareness.  The videos aren’t an editing trick.  He is repeatedly invading little girls spaces uninvited with hair sniffing whispering in their ears kissing them repeatedly and petting them awkwardly.  He ignores their discomfort and social cues. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeIad8_mhEI&t=26sThat's the smoking gun video. It's not cut.  I dare you to watch the whole 12 minutes and not come away thinking Biden is a pedo.    Literally young girl after girl he looks for pulls into his space and gropes.   This is in PUBLIC. Imagine in private. There is no way to take those videos out of context. Just watch it.You will get it. I'll take a look after work lol. I'm very much the antisocial type so I'd likely find it creepy at least for that reason. I definitely don't deny that my before mentioned uncle and Biden are weird or even a little creepy for expressing themselves that way but I'm hesitant to truly judge them for it.For context I love my uncle. He's a very open (maybe too open lol) and sweet person to be around. Though I don't know Joe personally nor do I pay much attention to him or his actions so I can't rightfully support him in full. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeIad8_mhEI&t=26sThat's the smoking gun video. It's not cut.  I dare you to watch the whole 12 minutes and not come away thinking Biden is a pedo.    Literally young girl after girl he looks for pulls into his space and gropes.   This is in PUBLIC. Imagine in private. This is exactly how I feel. We know he is creepy l there are many videos showing this but I can’t jump from creepy to sexual assault or rape without any evidence and neither should any other conservative. Last I checked being creepy wasn’t a crime. Being hypocritical only hurts the argument we should leave that to the left. What are you talking about?  Kavanaugh being a Trump nominee is all the proof evidence and reason to believe any top mind would need.Did Trump nominate Biden for anything?  I didn't think so.",0,False,t3_b8xn9m,115,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b8xn9m/alyssa_milanos_i_believe_kavanaugh_accuser/,913,,Alyssa Milano's 'I believe' Kavanaugh accuser becomes 'we can't assume' Biden guilt,913,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/alyssa-milanos-i-believe-kavanaugh-accuser-becomes-we-cant-assume-biden-did-wrong?f
ReaganTroll,"Good. He’s 70 now. As much as I like the guy RBG should be a lesson for supreme court strategy. Maybe he has a few more years before he starts losing his mind. Is it really worth the risk that he could be replaced by a Democrat later on? No it is not. If or When Trump wins his 2nd term as much as I love Thomas we 100% need to tag him out. Clone him and stick his clone on the bench I wouldn't mind a court that's just full of Scalia Gorsuch and Thomas clones. Thomas Jefferson's libertarian wet dream Instead of the head justice announcing rulings they all speak them in unison Make sure to change the name so it's not obvious. Tlarence Chomas Every republican should retire now and be replaced with a 40 year old. Starting with Roberts He said Republican. ba dum tsss I really hope we don’t get stuck in a position like the democrats are with RBG. Playing 'Weekend at Bernie's"" with a Supreme Court Justice? Just wait.. Barrett will be there for 50 years. Just imagine if Thomas Ginsburg and Breyer all retired. We’d have something like Roberts Alito Sotomayor Kagan Gorsuch Kavanaugh Barrett Thapar and Lee up there. Seriously is RBG still alive? She's been ghosting for months... Yes.  She attended the Supreme Court swearing-in ceremony last week.  This is the first proof of life that I've been aware of for awhile.  I met her in 2017 and her handlers were not allowing photos even at that time perhaps because of how frail she appears. The flash of the camera would knock her over If she retired all she would be remembered for is tapping out and giving Trump another pick. Dunno if she cares much about her legacy but it would be tarnished for sure. She could probably power through the 2020 elections.  If trump wins again might be hard to power through 4 more. More like 4 hours. I was at SCOTUS oral arguments last week and she was definitely there.  Unless they have a perfect body double doing an insanely good impression.  She asked 4-5 questions throughout the arguments. Were they relevant thoughtful questions? Yes but they could have been written by clerks for all I know.  The questions were as good as any of the others on the panel but she does speak extremely slowly compared to her peers.  She sounds exhausted and looks exceedingly frail.  Kind of feel bad for her.",0,False,t3_b8xu8f,27,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b8xu8f/clarence_thomas_says_hes_not_retiring_for_30_years/,207,,Clarence Thomas Says He's Not Retiring for 30 Years,207,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/clarence-thomas-says-hes-not-retiring-for-30-years
xFYD_,"This with CNN being in every airport every gym and every restaurant that isn't playing sports. Exactly. We have TV's set up in our lobbies and break rooms at work. One always has localized company news like upcoming events new product commercials metrics etc. The other always has CNN. One of the dudes on graves goes around on his lunch and changes all the CNN's to Fox with his android as a remote. Someone switches them all back every day. That is some mad passive aggressive shite going on there. Funny as heck. Wait till the 2020 elections gonna be some fights up in there. It's funny as fuck. Yeah when I was at college one of the janitors on the night shift would change lobby T.V.s to Fox News when he was cleaning up. Was the only time you ever saw it. Makes you long for the days you could delete the channel from the TV channel list... Tell him to put a piece of cellophane tape over the IR receiver after he changes it if it's an older TV... That's hilarious. Buddy of mine is a self professed flaming liberal. Well he gets a little drunk and asks me to follow him and his wife in his car back to the his place. I changed every radio preset in his car to fox News. He said if it wasn't so dastardly brilliant he would have killed me. The best part? He said it took him like three months to figure out all of them back. Thats great! Harmless things like that are good-natured ribbing. Something a little heavier that made me angry. House-sat for our neighbors when I was still in high school. My parents had a Bush sign out front in '00 and '04. They conveniently put their Gore and Kerry ones up immediately adjacent to our property line. No I didn't do anything with the signs. But this was in Nov. 2004 right after Bush was declared winner of the election. They gave me the lay of the land before leaving showed me where the dog and bird food was how to run the sprinklers. No problem. Have a great time. See you in a week. First day they're gone I realize they hung their American flag upside down out side their house before leaving on vacation. I kindly fixed it for them. When they got home I didn't say anything but they didn't ask me to housesit anymore. We had a WWII vet that walked around the block everyday and would talk cars with me when we were outside working on stuff. He was the one that first noticed their flag. Hit him pretty hard. He was well in his 80's and needed a cane to get around. But he asked me if I thought they knew what that meant and I said probably not. He just shook his head and walked on by. Dude sounds like good work buddy material. it happens all the time. Why are you questioning something that anyone can do and they do? With a name like his I highly doubt he's anything but a leftist and takes the entirety of CNN's porcine anal effluent as the Eucharist. What do you need proof? I could get my other friend Mueller to make a report for you. Would take a little while to get you a copy though. Thanks for chiming in Brick. Since when did sports nerds become so lefty? Are you proud of your city San Franshitsco? I live in South Carolina. Went to a conservative school. It’s a play on words. CNN really was the long con.A few years back they were the most neutral bland - frankly boring news but they didn't have the highly right-wing opinion programs of Fox nor the overt left-wing bias of MSNBC (once they showed up) -- so they were the best ""neutral"" choice to put on in places like that.But they were all of them deceived... Chuck Roberts and that chick who was slightly cross-eyed... Petition your local airport! I'll give my gym credit. They play Fox and CNN at the same time. AFAIK viewership from those venues do not go towards ratings however. Yeah but it's certainly advertising. CNN = Corporate terrorists At my local Mexican restaurant ( family owned) they play Fox. Hahahaaa. Where do you live? Here in the bible belt you see Fox News just as much — if not more in certain types of places. Same here.  Fox is EVERYWHERE; bars car washes dentist offices everywhere. I hate how at my Gym it's only CNN and MSNBC. Every time I look up at the screen there's something complete insanity going on up there.

707AL,"Its my understanding that Aztecs sacrificed adults as well. Whoever they conquered was up for their hearts being ripped out. I think they also specifically targeted pretty women and girls to sacrifice to the gods I believe and they even did it to their own people to appease the gods. No matter if they are a burden no matter what you call it no matter what your justifications are it is child murder. What does universal healthcare have to do with baby murder? Death through negligence I think is what they're getting at They want you to take care of the baby because they can't be assed to do it. Or because they literally cant afford the child but there weren't given the choice. So then a baby that has actually been born may die an unpleasant death through illness or malnutrition. They had plenty of options like not engaging in behavior wher ethere is a risk that your not able accept the outcome. Just because people cant keep it in their pants doesnt mean I need to open my wallet or that violently ending an incipient human life should be condone or legalized let alone funded by taxpayers. Are birth control pills murder?a) That depends.  Birth control pills are ammunition.  On their own they disrupt the lining of the uterus.  So if a woman is not sexually active but still taking birth control for some reason then no.However if a woman conceives a child while on birth control she has taken actions which are deliberately in order to induce a miscarriage.  So yes this is infanticide.And before anyone asks no this doesn't apply to condoms.  Condoms prevent a conception.2) Once the child is born is not providing it healthcare so it dies early murder?a) You're suggesting here that the state has an obligation to provide healthcare for its citizens otherwise it's implicated in ""murder.""  This is not logical since the state cannot provide healthcare per se.  The state can only force people in the state to ""provide healthcare"" for a lower cost than would ordinarily be charged or for free.3) The US has one of the highest infant mortality rates in modern countries is that a problem to you?a) Yes of course that's a problem to me.  I'm not sure what you're implying here.  Also I'm sure the %s would be much greater if we knew the number of children lost due to birth control pills.4) Do you support providing free birth control and sex ed which has a proven chance of reducing abortions which are murder to you?a) Firstly no I don't support free birth control pills as that still qualifies as inducing miscarriages.Secondly ""free sex ed"" or ""free anything"" just means forcing someone or some organization to do something they otherwise wouldn't.  The state itself cannot just provide things without cost.  So this is a separate ethical issue and no I wouldn't support free sex-ed and free condoms.If a school's sex-ed program chooses to give away condoms at their own expense (i.e. for 'free') then that is their choice and I would have no issue with that.5) Will you support universal healthcare to prevent the continued murder of babies?a) Firstly while a universal healthcare system does have the opportunity to ban abortions I certainly don't see that happening in the united states.  People that advocate for universal healthcare also usually advocate for access to abortions.  Secondly universal healthcare (broadly speaking) restricts individual liberty.  It restricts doctors from charging what they think their services are worth and it restricts patients from choosing where and how to get their healthcare.  Therefore universal healthcare is a separate and complex issue unto itself.6) What about paying higher taxes for better education?a) This is another complex issue because while I am all for better education I don't believe higher taxes necessarily results in better education.  At times at the county (not country) county level higher taxes can go directly to the schools in the area and many counties have done this and seen marked improvement in their local schools.  So this is possible and can be desirable.b) No I wouldn't support higher national income taxes for some broad sweeping national education program like Common Core.Or so you only care about children while they are unborn.a) Absolutely not.  This statement is ludicrous because the position from the outset is that the unborn child has just as much right to live as the child already born.We're talking about people taking direct action against a human life.  This is prohibited by law regarding any person already born and is unethical post-birth.  My position or broadly speaking our position as pro-life minded people is that a baby which has not made its way out of the womb is still a person and should be respected as a person.Aside /u/DragoonXNucleon your tone suggests we haven't thought our positions through.  We have legitimate reasons to be concerned about this issue and I think that on the whole pro-life thinking people should be taken much more seriously.  This is power over life and death we're talking about.  The pro-choice crowd has readily handed this kind of power to the state and laughed and scoffed at people who are truly concerned about their liberty their rights and the rights of others.  Please keep that in mind. Altar of convenience This is so dark I love it Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it. The crazy thing is we murder children at a rate higher than any nation in history. I think China has us beat. If God doesn’t deal with us for abortion He is going to need to apologize to Sodom. Ok so think about how heavy the ideology was within ancient Sacrificial culture to cause them to sacrifice their children. Now the same results are showing within liberal culture. Just shows how powerful that ideology is to their worldview. It was the Aztecs who built Chicen Itza and sacrificed people not the Maya. Thanks. sorry I don’t really know my ancient civilizations too well. Conservatives do not like abortions not birth control. Don’t let facts get in the way of his/her ideology. Pretty much. What do we want? Less access to birth control and condoms!Literally no one is calling for that.",0,False,t3_b8us8b,31,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b8us8b/some_things_dont_change/,500,,Some things don't change,500,https://files.catbox.moe/jfbsr1.png

Two points.Radical's goals are to create conflict in order to agitate their group and build advocates/acolytes/activists/new radicals to force negotiations / revolution.Everyone thinks they can radicalize opposing groups to combat the radicals so there's a counter balance. There's no balance. This actually works towards their favor as it helps radicalize their groups. The trick is outcome. You can agree that they think they have legitimate grievances and come up with neutral instead of radical solutions.E.g.Black people feel like there's systemic racism.The radical's goals are to encourage black people to feel oppressed become racist and to agitate them for a revolution. Then insert their real goal. Aka vote for Bernie Sanders / Hillary Clinton / Donate money to our organization / Kill a bunch of white people / Join the Muslim Brotherhood / whatever.What you should be doing. Acknowledge their feelings. Find the root cause of their grievance. Find solutions that are applied neutrally. Address the ways in which bad actors abuse the system against ANY individual and come up with appropriate solutions and system changes. It's because they need racism.  The assumption was that all the problems that blacks had were due to segregation and other forms of mistreatment.  The Civil Rights act knocked outlawed all that.  Blacks have not gotten better since then indeed their communities have gotten significantly worse.  A rational person would realize that the problem is that black people have low average IQ and the social programs are both providing opportunity and make it so no one cares to take that opportunity.  But Progressives prefer to keep blaming conservatives so they can double down on their bad policies with righteous fervor.  Rethinking their beliefs on human persons and human societies combined with losing their moral superiority is just too much.This explains why they act like saying ""the N word"" is witchcraft.  It's why ""racism"" is banned everywhere including this sub.  It's the scapegoat for all the failures of the last 50 years and a source of political capital.  In reality racism is pretty much harmless to adults. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sleight%20of%20hand The only way to win is not to play by their rules. They call you a racist?

Thats strange she seems to find the time to comment on everything else all day long From the Article:The crux of the complaint which was given  exclusively to Fox News in advance of its filing Wednesday accused  Ocasio-Cortez and her campaign manager Saikat Chakrabarti of  overseeing a ""shadowy web"" of political action committees (PACs) that  allowed them to raise more cash than they could have legally. It also  alleged that a limited liability company (LLC) was created to avoid  federal expenditure requirements by offering Ocasio-Cortez and other  Democratic candidates political consulting services at a price so low  that the company apparently shut down before the election was even over.The  complaint named Ocasio-Cortez Chakrabarti (now her chief of staff)  the Justice Democrats PAC the Brand New Congress PAC and Brand New  Congress LLC as the overlapping entities that aimed to “subsidize cheap  assistance for Ocasio-Cortez and other candidates at rates far below  market value.”Right there on the Justice Democrats platform: https://www.justicedemocrats.com/issuesEnd CorruptionSuper  PACs should be banned private donations to politicians and campaigns  should be banned and a clean public financing system should be  implemented to end the takeover of our government by corporations and  billionaires. Americans deserve free and fair elections — free from the  corruption of big money donors. The Supreme Court has effectively  legalized bribery. We need public financing of our elections.They can't even follow their own rules.On another note I am fairly confident that Chakrabarti and my former employer are bed fellows. Former employer is a Tax and Accounting firm that is owned and operated by a family from the state of Gujarat. They made money selling tax evasion services by doing something very similar to what Chakrabarti did with the LLC and they were hard core Democrat to the point they would do company meetings every election to tell their employees to go vote democrat.",0,False,t3_b8y5gk,4,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b8y5gk/alexandria_ocasiocortez_hit_with_fec_complaint/,64,,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez hit with FEC complaint for alleged 'subsidy scheme',64,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-hit-with-fec-complaint-for-alleged-subsidy-scheme
cathbadh,"Is this the same airport where she is mad croissants cost $7?Where does she expect the money to come from? She expects you to be taxed to pay for it.Socialism works as long as their are capitalists to pay for it. Who is John Gault? I’ll do you one better: why is John Gault? iUnderstoodThatReference.gif What's crazy is that it literally doesn't matter how much the croissants or anything cost. If the owner of the shop had everything marked up 5000% and profited $100 for every croissant that doesn't mean you deserve any piece of that. The owner of the shop used/risked his own funds to make a business and she thinks someone can walk in with a part time job and claim partial ownership to the profits.I try not to bash people individually but I don't think she's ever taken a beginner economics course. Her comment is so ignorant to how a business is run no she skipped the beginner classes and went straight to expert level because shes that much smarter than you peasants. Stop catcalling her from the cheap seats you nazi bigot! She actually minored in econ I believe. Would never guess that tho lol. No she didn't there is evidence coming out that she only took a few required economic classes for her degree Definitely not surprised. Especially after how she dogged New York with the Amazon fuck up. beginner economics courseI have a Econ degree. You can get a Econ degree and have almost no understanding of stuff like this or other real life Micro Economics transactions.  Half my class argued for raising min wage in one of my senor level classes. The Au Bon Pan sells one for $3.50 I have no idea wtf she was talking about. Maybe the higher wage is why the  croissant costs so much.In all seriousness though it's really frustrating how much more expensive the same goods are in an airport. Because I'm trapped in your security grid and have no other option I have to pay double for your turkey sub and bottle of water. I'm quite sure everyone on both sides can agree airport food is way too pricey. I always bring an empty plastic bottle through security and then fill it up at a water fountain. It's like seeing that weird politcally radical girl we all knew in high school be elected to office. We all stayed the hell away from her since we all knew she was an insane leftist conspiracy theorist/useful idiot who lapped up feminist/patriarchy pseudo-science like flat-earthers with their weird isolated community of self-made documentaries.She's a wound up ball of vindictive protectiveness syndrome and safety culture wrapped with a marxist bow. Modern leftists really are in a cult that rejects basic tennets of healthy scientifically proven psychology. AOC is basically what happens when you've been unwell your entire adult life and have somehow avoided seeing a good therapist. That $19 min wage is precisely why the croissant costs $7.This doesn’t speak highly to her Econ degree from Boston U. Sooo what are you gonna confront her and everyone else and really show that she is a fucking retard? Top Minds of Congress. Enact a $15/hr wage at the airport NOW by your representative AOC! Also make sure everyone knows she did it. It is 13 now and will be 15 in Sept. Maybe in Sept she will claim credit. 😂😂😂😂 Orange Man's Fault!

SuperCharged2000,"Defunding time? Defunding time. Yep Kentucky should start slashing Louisville's funding in increasing amounts so that it is forced to purge the university of worthless liberal arts departments. Dude UofL is a corrupt shitshow a Democrat haven buuuut I repeat myself.Hiring strippers for their basketball team recruiting events[Another basketball recruiting scandal this time involving athletics apparel and pro sports agents arranging extra payoffs for players to play at specific schools. Oh and the head coach from the above stripper scandal? Fired then he sued the university for breach of contract] (https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2017/11/30/16721864/rick-pitino-lawsuit-louisville-basketball-fbi-probe-breach-of-contract](https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2017/11/30/16721864/rick-pitino-lawsuit-louisville-basketball-fbi-probe-breach-of-contract) And this is a decade AFTER the dude fucked a married woman in the bathroom of a PF Changs and was extorted over the incident. Class act.After a complete clusterfuck of a failed foundation audit where trustees were paying themselves making huge profits from real estate deals being funneled through the audit etc the IRS is auditing them nowThe initial audit revealed the foundation had blown through $17.6 millionAnd when the KY Governor Bevin tried to clean up UofL using his authority as governor? The University started pushing back hard. Its been an ongoing feud since Bevin took office.The feud stems from Bevin's actions in 2016 to replace the board of trustees an action which came before the failed audits and the second recruiting scandal the one without the strippers. The Democrat state attorney general sued initially won but the ruling was overturned by the KY supreme court. As a side note a lot of uproar was made over how such a move 'risked UofL losing its accreditation.' That... was fake news.Of course that doesn't prevent UofL from removing trustees that are ideologically opposed to them. The founder of Papa Johns a UofL trustees member got trapped and I use that word very literally in a conference call which ""was designed as a role-playing exercise for Schnatter in an effort to prevent future public-relations snafus"" in which he used the n-word causing a massive backlash which got him fired from the board of trustees and his company's name removed from their stadium Side note: he was a Republican one of the only republicans on the UofL board of trustees. Maybe that's the actual reason his contract wasn't renewed. They did get defunded and are finally cutting worthless liberal degree programs. Literally be a Child Psychologist Be an expert on what's good for a child's development say transgenderism is toxic to children be fired for hurting tranny feelings The trans movement absolutely believes that this isn't a trend but rather the sudden unveiling of thousands upon thousands of transsexuals due to a newly ""woke"" culture and medical establishment. Doctors and scientists who aren't on board have to keep their heads down or be ejected. It's a tragedy. They're not trans they're radicals. They're trying to build advocates. They're running campaigns to turn children into trans. CAMPAIGNS. They want to mutilate children for marketing purposes. MARKETING. Think about that for a while. Precisely.  And for that very reason—seeking “confirmation” of the social science—these woke adults are affecting the ordinary development of suggestible children who internalize the fraught emphasis on their gender and sexuality categories.Some kids may be genuinely confused even before the wishful indoctrinations;  some simply want to please; some want the Queen For A Day treatment at home and in school perhaps as a diversion.  A minute fraction are the real thing.Imagine the pressure on those kids years after the trans fanfare and the parental vaunting and accessorizing who come to realize it was literally premature hogwash after all.   It would be like leaving a cult.  The suicide rates are no coincidence. The patients are running the asylum “Child psychologists all agree that giving young children irreversible life altering treatments is a good thing!”Yeah because you will attempt to ruin their lives and put them in the poor house if they don’t toe the line for your cause of the month. He did not even say that transgenderism is toxic or that it is not valid.He just advocated a 'going slow' approach as children are not known for their decision making abilities.This is a very moderate position that he is being ostrasized for.And this is troubling.The only accepted position is apparently the radical one?This is intellectually unhealthy. Good for him! I fully agree with him. Any parent that allows and encourages a CHILD to undergo any sort of gender changing procedure should be locked up in prison. Do what you want once you’re 18 but before then you’re still developing and figuring out who you are.I really hope he wins that lawsuit. Americans (Conservatives) are under attack and it’s our job to fight the system tooth and nail. There is plenty of science to suggest that your brain hasn't fully developed until you're in your 20s. I for one did a lot of stupid shit in my early 20s. At this point the evidence is overwhelming that it takes until around age 25 for the rational part of our brains to fully mature specifically the prefrontal cortex which regulates decision-making long-term planning and risk management along with impulse control. In other words rational thinking. And even after its mature you aren't really settled in your thinking till about 35. Agree! You are the gender god gave you while your under my roof until 18. Then you can make your own decisions. Children aren't even allowed to decide what time they go to bed but all of a sudden they can choose to get their dicks cut off and get hormone injections because they want to play with the girls.  Incredible Why anyone would seek higher education right now is beyond me. Its like they are actively trying to make a degree completely worthless.Young men reading this. Get into a trade that you enjoy master it and build a business in the right location for said trade. Universities are largely leftist pits right now and a lot are jokes but I still have to disagree strongly with your comment. Everybody on earth can't build a business or even just go and master a trade. The same thing doesn't work for everybody. Sure there are a lot of people who what you describe works great but for others it's not the right move.I'm going to school for electrical engineering right now and that is absolutely not going to be a worthless degree no matter what the left does to college. Other people want to be scientists doctors lawyers teachers engineers I could go on and on. College is the right move for a lot of people. Telling people not to go to college is not really good advice as there is still a lot of value in going to college as long as you're getting an actual useful degree. For myself EE degree was a great choice it sucks that the schools are so much more messed up than they were 15 years ago but EE opens up many career options especially if you have a passion for it. My dad has an engineering degree so I have plenty of advice and I am not claiming to have it all figured out. I don't even disagree with your advice I'm just saying that telling people not to go to college isn't good advice for EVERYBODYYour statement made it seem like nobody should be going to college and that everyone will be better off being a trade worker and that's not the case for everybody. It's hard work being a trade worker and it often comes with less benefits job security and pay. For others being a trade worker is an awesome thing to do. I know lots of people who are extremely successful financially with no degree but I also know a lot of people who are successful who have degrees. College isn't a waste of time if it's taken seriously and with a good field of study What? Dude you're sounding really bitter about nothing. The guy responding to you is correct. Not everyone can master a trade and build a business. We're all in agreement that universities have gone way downhill in the way of a leftist climate taking over but that doesn't mean you can't still get some benefit out of going. Like the other guy said choose a solid major that has to do with science and technology keep away from the politics at school study hard and you'll be in a much more competitive position that most of the people graduating with you. Do you think that all ends at graduation?The leftist nonsense is fully leeched into the workplace.Except now you cant speak up because it could mean your job. It doesnt end at graduation--it begins.I'm just warning you young bucks. I'm not bitter. I'm not resentful. I'm not angry.I'm honest. Huh? Why so many upvotes for the original comment? I'm not sure what you mean or why you're being defensive. I agreed with most of what you said except:Why anyone would seek higher education right now is beyond me.I just wanted to point out that there are plenty of reasons for plenty of people that seeking higher education is a good idea. You make it out as if everyone who goes to college is wasting their time and that is not the case. You're coming off as a giant dbag fwiw I'm not trying to CONVINCE anyone. If you seriously believe that ANYONE who goes to college is wasting their time then I really don't know what else to say. College is absolutely a good choice for many people as is mastering a trade for other people.People all take different paths in life and not one path is best for everybody. College still has a place in this country despite all the issues that it currently has I think you're being reasonable. I don't know what you do but there's zero chance of doing what I do without a degree to start so people are going to have to tough it out sadly. What do you do? Analog integrated circuit designThere's plenty of easier things to do for more money but I wouldn't trade it for hardly anything I admire your passion. Exactly why I went to school too.Keep it up!! I agree with this but for someone like me who wants to be a teacher I have no choice but to get a higher education. That is commendable. I hope you are able to teach the truth.The article here and many like it are demonstrating that you can get fired for just that. Facts and truth.The future of the country depends on this profession not poisoning future generations.

kanhawk,California where drugs are legal citizenship is optional and it’s not a crime to intentionally infect people with AIDS… punishing another state for passing laws that protect religious freedom. Go figure. And human poop in the streets.  Don't forget the human poop in the streets. And tents filled with homeless people next to the freeway. Hey those homeless people in tents are the first line of defense against the next Islamic truck attack. Lucky South Carolinians! You won't have any Californians visiting your state. Count this as a win. Well just state employees on official business. I don't know about the whole state but my last couple of work trips to LA certainly highlighted why I'll never live there.  All of that tax money and whinging about roads and bridges and theirs are the worst I've ever seen.  Also muh guns. Edit:. Meant to reply to u/dash47 My sister lives out there and she's leaving as soon as she can sell her house she said California has turned into a s**thole Same is. The cause with my brother in laws brothers. They are migrating en masse cause california has become a shit  hole over run by immigrants and crazy laws. They will leave their high paying jobs and a comfortable life style cause they belive in themselves It has.  And it's getting worse.If you've got enough money - I'm not talking Silicon Valley techbro money but minimum six figure annual income - and if you don't mind decaying public infrastructure to include schools and roads then you can still be comfortable in California.  But you can live the same or better lifestyle for lower cost with greater ease out of state and under much less oppressive taxation and regulation.I'm hardly the first to observe that California is transforming into a neo-feudal landscape where the ultra-wealthy live in and rule from walled coastal enclaves a small (and ever-shrinking) middle class provides the service industry (nearly all manufacturing having been regulated or taxed out of state) and the vast majority of the population is dirt poor and either unemployed or working low wage manual labor jobs.Adjusted for costs California has the highest poverty rate in the nation.  25% of the most 'economically challenged' cities in the nation are in California.  Home ownership for most Californians is now a luxury rather than something to be expected; the state's green policies have driven housing costs past most people's ability to afford.  The state is collapsing and the response of the political class is to double down on the policies that have created the problem.  The next real recession that impacts Silicon Valley will likely bring down the state. State of Jefferson now more than ever Keep it up Kalifornia... All the other states banned are nice places. Mississippi gets shit all the time but it’s a pretty state. Kansas ain’t bad either if you like big sky and no goddamn neighbors or HOAs They should pass federal legislation to end this.

ScorchMain6123,Feminism is synonymous with authoritarian thinking. Bullying behaviors under the guise of fighting for the little woman.

If I were in that class I’d have your back and she’d be like ‘WTF!?!?’ Thanks I'm sure that'd make her head explode (not literally nobody's calling for violence calm down topminds) I get called a coconut for not toeing the BS line on this. The people that peddle this crap get legit ""offended"" I think it's crap. Is coconut an insult? I never heard it.People I allow around me do not say that kind of thing though. Speak up. Engage in debateHow can you hope to stop it if you just ""keep your head down""Nobody who ever made change in America kept their head downand if you're not willing to fight it then you don't really have the right to complain about itBecause by doing nothing you're essentially becoming a accompliceIf you need arguments and talking points we can provide them here. For starters you could just use the definition of racism as provided by Merriam-Webster to talk about how racism is racism. Oppression requires power and things like that. Racism does notyou can talk about the NYU play that basically functioned as a study. Where they re held the debates word-for-word and the actors said each word exactly as the candidates stand and even made the exact same hand motions. The only difference with the Donald Trump was played by a woman and Hillary Clinton was played by a man. What did the study find? Donald Trump supporters didn't really change their vote. But Hillary Clinton supporters preferred Donald Trump as a woman. Meaning that she really did only have support because of sexism Tell me in 5000 words or less how wave division multiplexing affects minority communities in the USA.  You will not get a passing grade unless you use ""systemic racism"" at least 400 times. Something about 5000 words and why we need more Divisions in the Army and Marines. I can do that! As for the systemic racism I’ll just say Congress is being racist towards servicemembers (even used a gender non specific term there!) lel :) The most disheartening part of your story isn’t the teacher spouting her anti-intellectual nonsense but that most the class followed along like an army of NPCs. I do believe as some them get older they will get wiser . One can only hope. Most of the class including opop didn't speak up.He didn't challenge them.and they might have been one or two other people just like him in the class. Maybe the whole class? The fact that nobody tries to even challenge it or fight it means that I can persistyou can make excuses all day long but at the end of the day the real reason but you don't stand up and fight is out of fear and lazinessif you don't want to fight that's fine. Nobody can force you to fight for something. But if you don't want to fight for it then you don't have the right to complain about it I'd like to suggest to you to reread my post again and then tell me again how I didn't challenge her or speak up. Another interesting I hear you might be able to do is do a report and read it out loud to the class.but not just any report. What you're going to do is you're going to take a speech word-for-word for me to the 50s or beforehand From some racist or bigoted group speaking out against gay people or black people or some marginalized group. You're going to take a speech against that group and you're going to take the words and you're going to replace the words black with white. Org a with white. You could even take it from one of Hitler's speechesAnd then what are you filet replaced all the right phrases you're going to read it out loud to the class. I guarantee they'll be nodding their heads by the end of it and then you're going to tell them that it's a word for word speech from Adolf Hitler any u replaced the word black with one it's what I would say. Point out how black people are actually the group in power. Point out how laws are designed to benefit black people which is the opposite of systemic oppressionprint out how the definition of racism has nothing to do with the group in powerI point out that anybody who promotes discrimination against anybody for their race is inherently racist and bad.Force her to literally advocate for discriminating against an entire group of people based on their race.you might not change her mind because she's racist but you can certainly change the people listening to her.Force her into a position where the things that she says out loud sounds so incredibly racist and bigoted to any normal person listening would be appalledBecause you have to remember: These people are Beyond hope. they have embraced their ignorance and racism and created an ideology out of itBut wen you're debating somebody you're not trying to change their mind. You trying to help the people listeningjust make sure that you don't get emotional. Stick to facts and try to force her into a position where the things that come out of her mouth sound incredibly racist and bigoted to anybody listemingthen for the rest of the semester the classes and going to take her seriously I think he did what he could within reason.  Spoke his point pushed a little and let it go when he saw he wasn't going to get anywhere.  No point in endangering his grade/career plans for little gain. Yeah. University is nasty now. Doing my first year of uni in canada (originally from Minnesota) and holy crap I can hardly stand it. And I'm not even in any classes where I should be experiencing it! That's how deep some of this liberal crap is worked into the profs.I didn't consider myself much into politics. I had my values and voting would be based on those. But now I have to be just to have a chance at defending my views to anyone. I miss the simpler times. Yea I had to put up with shit like this in college (graduated 2017). It’s just as bad as everyone says it is. These professors are fucking nuts.White Male Engineer Please attempt to comfort yourself with the fact that depending on your field your starting salary was probably equal to the bs peddling professor's and you'll be out earning them in a useful field soon. He can take more solace in the fact that in 5 years he'll have doubled their salary.source: Am engineer. Yeaaaaa bbutttttt... I live in Cali so I’m fucked. :D So you ""put up with it"".

My degree is in Networking but I am forced to take a ""diversity"" type of class in order to fulfill my graduation requirements... Okay fine I never complained about it but thought it was ridiculous in the first place. Anyway I picked Intro to Sociology.

You know how we make fun of people who say that you can't be racist against white people or who say that there is no such thing as reverse racism or discrimination because it's being done against people in ""power"" and therefore it doesn't count?

Yea that shit is being taught seriously in a college setting to young impressionable kids and they ARE kids. Kids who have barely left their parents teats and have only experienced school as their primary life experience.

The teacher (a white female) was asking for examples of discrimination or prejudice (this was before she told us the definition of how it doesn't count when it's done against white people). I spoke up and pointed out how Jordan Peele recently stated that he wouldn't be hiring any white male leads anytime soon and she DENIED that as being an example because he's black and the group he would be doing it against is the majority in power group (white males).

Needless to say I fought back instantly at that absurd statement in many forms starting by asking if it was James Cameron who said something like that about black people if it would be prejudice or discrimination then (she answered ""of course!"") then I straight up asked her doesn't that mean it's open season on white people if minorities would never get charged with discrimination or prejudice (she responded with ""it's open season on minorities""...) and finally I just said that Sociology is wrong (which she didn't take too kindly to because she asked why and other students (class is like 70% white) drowned me out defending HER position)). After that she quickly moved on (at this point class was almost over).

So long story short she is teaching the white kids in class that if they have a minority employer or a supervisor who discriminates against them because of the color of their skin that they have no right to complain about it and she is teaching the minorities in her class that if they do discriminate against white people it's okay because Sociology has changed the definition of racism/discrimination/prejudice to mean it can't be done against white people.

It's the most insane shit I have ever heard in my life in a college setting (this is my 3rd college because I move around a lot).

Please I implore you if you have kids you have to warn them about things like this. You have to be there for them and you have to teach them right. 

While Sociology will not be there to defend them the law will and that's all that matters.

chabanais,House Committee on Oversight and Reform chair Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) wrote to former Fox News reporter Diana Falzone last month demanding that she turn over any documents relating to Trump’s alleged extramarital affairs.I don’t know why did other outlets sit on the BETO stuff until after the mid terms? But it's Trump who is dangerous to a free and open press. Ironically enough Trump is a prerequisite for a healthy free press. Editors deliberately lying and making stuff up has to be called out by an influential figure. Even the NYT acknowledges how damaging Obama was to the free press. Cummings is just continuing along the same lines. How about investigating all the other stations on why they sat on the Access Hollywood story?Could it be that they really wanted Trump to be the GOP nominee because they figured he was the only one that Hillary could beat? Stay in your lane Cummings. They want total control of the media like pre-war Germany. Ironic how we are labeled the Nazis in 2019. Having Elijah Cummings chair a committee on oversight and reform is like letting a fox watch the hen house.  No pun intended. There has to be some rule somewhere to force Cumnings out of the chairmanship.

Now I can't say I always agree with those subs but I occasionally like seeing what the outliers to PC culture's opinions are and that's a great place to find them.Anywhere else and something like accepting personal responsibility or responsible gun ownership is non-existent just to name two issues that come up a lot.

I can't say I would agree with the philosophy of Red Pill or MGTOW but they are opposed to this awful PC culture we have to deal with now. My leftist friends say that reality has a liberal bias. I prefer the view that a conservative is just a liberal that has been mugged by reality. Hahah i love that. My leftist friends say that reality has a liberal bias.If you want to talk about reality then look at how nature worked the past several billion years to develop life. Nothing vaguely liberal or progressive about it. Nature's red in tooth and claw. It's a good thing he said ""reality"" and not ""nature"". You know things like science fact-checking constantly evolving social norms and basic human empathy. If you try to separate nature from reality you end up in a dreamland. Math has a right wing bias. It definitely offers many right angles. That’s a ridiculous statement and argument to make. I have conversations with my somewhat liberal friend in NY who always tries to describe liberal policy as “rational” “logical” or “progressive”. This is a common tactic of people on either side though more common amongst liberals to use those buzzwords so when you disagree with them you’re “irrational” “illogical” or “regressive”.It’s the same thing here where he says people navigate towards truth resulting in liberal media pundits so as to inversely say anyone not liberal doesn’t care about the truth or any non-liberal media isn’t truthful.My advice would be to let him know that’s a logical fallacy thus a poor argument to make. There are reasons the media is profoundly liberal leaning and truth ain’t it. I half disagree.  I think it used to be that way.  We've gone from being labeled ""irrational and illogical"" to now being called ""evil and dangerous"".   This is a problem because one needs to enlighten someone who is illogical but one must suppress and remove those who are evil and dangerous.

I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in 1987 and although I felt I received a good education for my efforts and money I was convinced you could get through a CS degree without learning any significant amount of programming.  I can't imagine it's any better most in other fields or 30 years later. I keep saying this she has a Bachelor of ARTS in economics.  She basically took it for audit. If I was Boston University I would be embarrassed. She doesn’t. She claims she has a BA in Economics from Boston University. Supposedly she only had like 12 credits in courses focused on Economics but I read that offhand yesterday and could be false for all I know.

I'm curious what their source is on ""International Economics Business and Politics Track"" being the source of her economics claim. Like her graduate record just says BA Cum Laude and a degree in International Relations on an economics track wouldn't be called ""a degree in International Relations and Economics"". It would just be called ""An International Relations Degree"" saying ""and economics"" implies a double major.  That said even if that person IS right about her degree all they've shown is that we don't KNOW how many econ courses she took. The list they're in the minimum required. She could have taken every single elective in econ and everything on that page would still be true. Whenever anyone says to you that they support $15/hr min wage ask them why not $20? or $50? or $100? If raising it is such a benefit why stop at $15? I can tell you from experience that it won't have the desired effect. They will tell you that something can be good in moderation but will have bad results in excess. They will also insinuate that you're mentally deficient for not understanding this if you try to make them explain how a minimum wage that is too high will end badly without having that explanation also apply to their proposed minimum wage. Ask them if they're willing to pay Timmy down the street $15/hr to mow their lawn. Make it applicable to their personal circumstances. If they don't respond to that then they are lost. Who are you getting to mow your lawn for less than $15 an hour?I live in an extremely low cost of living area and it would be at least $20 or $30 to have someone mow my lawn  and it wouldn't take them an hour.  Heck when I was mowing lawns at a teenager back more than 20 years ago I was getting $15 to mow a lawn that took me about 30 minutes.I get what you are trying to say but that isn't a good example. I got $5 for mowing around the same time. No one factors in geographical area. $15/hr sounds low in Seattle but in my area $15/hr would support a family (I supported 4 kids on less). Therefore I believe the federal min wage should be set at the lowest of the 50 states if not zero. Here in NY with good old AOC no one pays Timmy to do the lawn.

alc59,This is so ridiculous. Barr said in his summary that he would work with Mueller to release the report. He just isn't going to release classified or secret information which would be against the law:For that reason my goal and intent is to release as much of the Special Counsel's report as I can consistent with applicable law regulations and Departmental policies.Based on my discussions with the Special Counsel and my initial review it is apparent that the report contains material that is or could be subject to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) which imposes restrictions on the use and disclosure of information relating to “matter[s] occurring before [a] grand jury.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2)(B). Rule 6(e) generally limits disclosure of certain grand jury information in a criminal investigation and prosecution. Id. Disclosure of 6(e) material beyond the strict limits set forth in the rule is a crime in certain circumstances. See e.g. 18 U.S.C. § 401(3). This restriction protects the integrity of grand jury proceedings and ensures that the unique and invaluable investigative powers of a grand jury are used strictly for their intended criminal justice function.Given these restrictions the schedule for processing the report depends in part on how quickly the Department can identify the 6(e) material that by law cannot be made public. I have requested the assistance of the Special Counsel in identifying all 6(e) information contained in the report as quickly as possible. Separately I also must identify any information that could impact other ongoing matters including those that the Special Counsel has referred to other offices. As soon as that process is complete I will be in a position to move forward expeditiously in determining what can be released in light of applicable law regulations and Departmental policies.The Democrats want to see all the raw material because they want 1) to leak whatever they can to their favored outlets 2) to have what happened with the completely fabricated dossier in that it creates complete chaos and continues this conspiracy theory for another two or more years.,0,False,t3_b8ytyj,2,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b8ytyj/house_judiciary_democrats_authorize_subpoenas_for/,11,,House Judiciary Democrats authorize subpoenas for Mueller report,11,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-judiciary-democrats-authorize-subpoenas-for-mueller-report

The word exegesis is used all the time when discussing religion and theological studies. Exegesis is an entire branch of theology relating to critical religious ideology analysis and how to interpret original texts and scripture.This is why the specific word choice here is so cutting as a criticism because Cardinal Sarah is a prominent church leader and he is calling out people who are using false or outright manipulative interpretations of Biblical scripture to push this viewpoint saying it is erroneous according to scripture. Yes. It's used in theology all the time regarding Scripture. Plus we Catholics have a bunch of words we use that are very close to the original Latin and occasionally Greek.

davidlah,"We're all gonna die she saysI don't agree with AOC on anything but damnit I have to agree with her on this one. In 12 years Y2k y2k12 now y2k31. But don't forget that the 2038 problem is still very much an actual reality.  It's a actually a bigger issue than Y2K ever was (disregarding the fear-mongering hype that Y2K was) We will never know how bad Y2K could have been based on the extraordinary efforts made to keep it from being as bad as the hype. Yea but we won't have to experience it we will be dead before then. I know I've died dozens of times this year alone from gun violence! (93 million Americans a day per Terry McAuliffe) Hah I forgot about her. I support reasonable gun-control and it's people like her that make us look like idiots. I love when they give an actual deadline. Allows us to fact check them and they're always wrong.Of course they try to get around it by claiming there are already disastrous consequences of global warming. Any time there is any bad weather they just blame it on global warming. We've had a very low number of hurricanes the past 20 years but they still blame every hurricane on man made climate change.Then they'll make fun of people who point out record cold temperatures don't match their narrative. We've had a very low number of hurricanes the past 20 years but they still blame every hurricane on mandmade climate change.In the last 20 years hurricanes have actually increased in frequency. This is a verifiable fact assuming you trust the numbers from the NOAA. Also the rising ocean temps fuel the increasing number of hurricanes making them more powerful and last longer. Just in the last 24 years we have had 16 worse than average hurricane seasons. We can measure the temps of the ocean and verify that higher temps do in fact make for worse hurricanes. I wouldn't use this as your example if I were you. The higher temperatures are just because we use more wind power now so we use up the wind before it can cool the ocean /s You know I think you're right. I must have heard some stat about fewer hurricanes making landfall or something. It does look like hurricane activity is up. Record cold temperatures does match the narrative though It absolutely does :)Climate change isn't exactly distillable into a few patterns. Climate is the culmination of weather. When you watch the news that guy telling you the temp is the ""weather"" man. They can predict how the globe responds to oceanic and lake-sourced temperature impacts in short amounts of time. These ""record cold temperatures"" are just snapshots of time. The real importance is in the patterns which you already admit are present. If climate change wasn't real why are we seeing a higher rate of increased temperatures?Ignoring temps cause they only started recording that data in the 1800s you can use all kinds of other incredibly reliable sources to determine global temperatures hundreds of thousands of years ago. You have probably seen this diagram but it is one of best showcases of temperatures from 20000 years ago until now. Humans most certainly caused this. just make sure to buy a snorkel at least if you live on the coast i never remembered this subreddit completely falling for the MAGA propaganda... I know AOC sounds crazy and some of it is but there's some reality in there. You should check out Andrew Yang he's really good at explaining all this stuff but without any of the politics. he's running for pres 2020 there’s some reality... because she used proper sentence structure and sometimes decent spelling?Sorry but AOC hate has NOTHING to do with Trump. Nothing. The woman is the poster child for raving liberal colleges everywhere with no basis in reality. She was voted into office despite the fact that she is ignorant and incompetent.Did I mention no one hates her because of Trump or “Maga”?

scrubking,"She was summarily fired by the music shop she worked at - per the shop’s facebook page. As a musician and someone who sees the music industry generally leaning heavily left I’m really glad to finally see some equity. Oh no the “Tolerant Left”?Just further proves to me that this is no longer a matter of morals and values but a game of identity politics for the Left. They preach acceptance of 50 different genders but not at the very least tolerate someone with opposing ideals? They've shifted the conversation into these aren't people they're facists who want to kill your friends. They've moved the window so far to the left that they've genuinely convinced themselves that it's some kind of battle to survive. They're a couple years out from a terrorist organization. I remember a few months before Trump took office all of the far lefties I know were like “OH MY GAWD IM LEAVING IF HES PRESIDENT”.Then leave. Unless you’re super wealthy (which none of these people I know are) involved in high levels of business or are illegal Trumps presidency hasn’t rocked the world of the average US citizen.Totally agree though. I wait for the day the Left is forced to denounce their fringe groups that they hold onto so tightly. They only seem to target old people and children. The only times they target able adults is when it’s many vs one. They are cowards every one of them. Hey sometimes they target adults with bike locks. They should never underestimate old man strength. Remember the vet on the bus with the black guy?  That old vet beat him like a drum. Call an amberlance! Whoa Black Betty Amber Lamps Lol Vietnam Tom. Funny thing is I just saw him a few months ago in San Francisco. Dudes a lot skinnier than in that video. Looks like he has been smokin the meths. Well yea have you seen the videos where they try and antognize a grown man in his 30s? It's hilarious. Not the assaulting of old people and children but the result of picking a fight with someone ""their size"" so to speak Imagine if these 'punch Nazis' types actually went to the bars clubs and other places where legit neo-nazi aryan supremacy types hang out to pick fights.It's no wonder they limit their 'direct action' to sucker punching some geology major with a MAGA hat. 🔥🔥🔥 Bashing the fash is all fun and games until the fash bashes back. Not cheering on fascism or anything just pointing out that a fundamental flaw of ideology that encourages you to call animals you dont like bears and poke them is that you run the risk of occasionally finding an actual bear and being mauled. How can you go up to an old man minding his own business start screaming at him and think you're NOT the crazy one? I don't even care if the old guy is wearing a Nazi hat (yeah literally the worst thing ever). You can't just bug someone who isn't doing anything but drinking coffee. This doesn't make you a hero. CNN told them so. ""Woman"".Cracks me up. ""Man Key"" cracks me up. More like women. Lol She should be banned from Starbucks for blatantly calling for his doxing and vigilante justice to be put upon him.  There will be no justice for this old man though because Starbucks is a large corporate structure with past instances of the SJW narrative.  It's a shame how much the culture was is actually turning into a war in the streets. She looks and acts insane. Seems to me that old man could have accidentally thrown his hot coffee in that thing's face. Old people sometimes have uncontrollable muscle spasms you know?

SuperCharged2000,Trade is VERY important.So is having borders.Our detention facilities are at capacity.  The borders are a bigger issue. It's more than that. The long term stability of these United States is literally at risk with an endentured servitude-esque class rapidly changing the makeup of the United States.Better vote for us or else What he should’ve done is closed the border during the shutdown for leverage. Government isn’t operating no one can come in. He could still try again next year if the emergency gets held in courts. What the liberal media and the left in general don’t understand is that while the border closure will absolutely have a negative impact on the economy it will have a disproportionately larger impact on the Mexican economy.  Mexico knows this.  Mexico needs to start enforcing the first safe port rules and take these migrants in themselves assess their refugee claims and deny them as they should be because they’re simply economic migrants looking to bankrupt a new nation after harvesting their own. USA should declare an embargo to Mexico Honduras and Guatemalla until the stop the coyotes and the Caravans. They would give in in a day or two. I'm not holding my breath. I've been hearing about border security for a while now with not a whole lot actually getting done. We can hope though. I can sacrifice my avocado toast for this Just put a moratorium on immigration and asylum until further notice.  Just tell them sorry the illegal immigrants ruined it for the rest of you. That’s like punishing the whole class because a couple of fucktard kids wouldn’t stop talking Guess what happens when you do that?  The class starts self policing and they take care of the problem themselves. That’s bullshit of the highest order. People who are crossing the border legally have no ability to stop other people from crossing it illegally. The governments of those people most certainly have the ability to turn back the massive caravans and step up security on their side of the border. The whole class needs to be reminded that actions have consequences. Five years ago I’d be more in your camp - my patience has run out. Respect the rules of the house. You and I would never be given such leeway to break the law. But the “whole class” isn’t breaking the law. Some trucker carrying flat screen TVs into San Diego can’t stop illegal immigrants from coming. True but our house is on fire. Avocados and flatscreens are less pressing when your city is sinking below the strain of housing educating and medicating a slew of near helpless new comers that are also destroying the culture of the people living there.Edit: punctuation Oh well.

ReaganTroll,As an alumnus of Calvin College and former resident of Michigan from both the Flint region and the rural areas further north much of what the article says is true. I would have a couple of critiques for it though. Western Michigan was and is not as nearly as dependent upon the auto industry as Detroit and Flint once were. There is more diversity business-wise. One of the things that had led to Michigan having a degree of economic success is the tourism. Believe it or not the Great Lakes draw a lot of little for fishing boating swimming etc. There is also a massive amount of historical sites as well as a ton of natural sites. However the social values in Flint Detroit and some of the larger cities are definitely different from the rest of the state which explains so many of the problems of these cities. Entitlement is a real problem there. Michigan population growth in general seems to have stalled for the last 40 years.

sexymurse,In a letter to The Federalist justifying its refusal to provide the request records the FBI claimed that the request for emails to and from a specific domain sent or received on two specific dates was “overly broad” did not provide “enough detail to enable personnel to locate” the records and sought information in “vague and undefined terms.” The FBI further claimed that the underlying request itself which specified both the date and the sender’s or recipient’s email domain did not comply with federal regulations regarding requests for information made under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).Using the same rationale the FBI also rejected a separate FOIA request from The Federalist which specifically requested any and all FBI emails on the day of the Stone raid sent to or from Josh Campbell a former FBI employee who worked under James Comey former director of the FBI and now works as a law enforcement analyst for CNN as well as any and all emails from that day specifically mentioning Roger Stone.“To the extent possible requesters should include specific information that may assist a component in identifying the requested records such as the date title or name author recipient subject matter of the record case number file designation or reference number” state the federal regulations governing FOIA requests. “In general requesters should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records that they are seeking.”The FBI did not explain how a request noting a specific date specific character string and specific sender or recipient did not satisfy federal regulations covering open records requests made pursuant FOIA.Last year the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Justice which oversees the FBI issued a scathing report detailing a culture of unauthorized leaking within the FBI.“We have profound concerns about the volume and extent of unauthorized media contacts by FBI personnel that we have uncovered during our review” the inspector general wrote in the report. “We identified numerous FBI employees at all levels of the organization and with no official reason to be in contact with the media who were nevertheless in frequent contact with reporters.”“We do not believe the problem is with the FBI’s policy which we found to be clear and unambiguous” the report noted. “Rather we concluded that these leaks highlight the need to change what appears to be a cultural attitude among many in the organization.”The inspector general also suggested that FBI personnel were receiving gifts from reporters in exchange for leaks including “tickets to sporting events golfing outings drinks and meals and admittance to nonpublic social events.”The report noted that the inspector general’s office was conducting a separate investigation on the brewing gifts-for-leaks scandal within the FBI and would release that report to the public once it was concluded.https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/02/fbi-refuses-records-requests-for-e-mails-to-cnn-on-day-of-roger-stone-raid/ What's the update on Roger Stone?

We can give their aid to the United states. Guam is included in the United States. So is Puerto Rico. I think it was said in the above hypothetical scenario that Puerto Rico would no longer be part of the US. ....Hawaii doesn't count? When did they vote not to become a state? The last two referendums have resulted in pro-statehood winning https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Puerto_Rican_status_referendums.Please provide your sources. No representation without taxation. Is that how it works? Puerto Rico is a US territory and not a state so its residents don't pay federal income tax unless they work for the US governmentCorrect. yeah rhetorical question :) representation without taxation.Should go the other way too. If you aren't paying taxes you shouldn't have a say over the livelihoods of those who do. Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States. Because it is not a state it has no senators and its representative in the House of Representatives is a delegate called the Resident Commissioner with limited voting privileges. Delegates have a marginalized role in Congress and their constituents are not represented in Congress in the same manner as most citizens.  [Source] (https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/PR)If you're a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico during the entire tax year you generally aren't required to file a U.S. federal income tax return if your only income is from sources within Puerto Rico. [Source] (https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc901)So they have some representation/responsibilities albeit limited. In most cases they don't pay Federal income taxes. Anyone have a source on that $91 Billion figure? I'm sure it's real but the numbers quoted by FEMA are nowhere near that. So far I've found that 41b will be allocated over the course of the next decade or so.Cant tell if he has somethi g up his sleeve or if he's just winging it on Twitter today. Yeah no shit.I'm curious as to why he would blatantly inflate the number as much as he is. I'm not claiming it's some 4D chess bullshit. I'm inquiring as to the angle.He hasn't lied like that in a while and he's at an advantage right now so I'm curious to know if there's anything more to his tweet other than being a throwback to his pre-2018 twitter style. He also just lied about where his father was born.  There are some things that can be excused as trying to make a statement I guess but then lying about easily disproved things such as his father's birthplace I don't understand. Wait ""lying to make a statement"" is excusable? He has been doing this for years. That is how he is. I guess I'm just curious because he seemed to have chilled out a bit. I'm not surprised or anything but this seems like a good way to push away the moderates who are undoubtedly being pushed in your direction ya know? I concur. It makes him hard to defend. We spend time bashing AOC for her nonsense but let Trump slide on even more blatantly wrong claims. All part of the game I guess.It's really best to just acknowledge when he's pulling some crap. I don't have a problem with saying he's often destructive and foolish while also admitting that I find any current potential democratic candidate to be a worse option. I think he's seeing the 2020 re-election polls and getting flustered. Because Dems aren't leading him in the polls? Well that was his recipe for victory last time around. There is no source because he's lying. The hurricane caused 91 billion in damage. They didn't get that in aid.Good lord someone needs to take away his phone. He's off the rails today.Edit: Just saw that he also blatantly lied about his father being born in Germany. His father was born in NYC. What's the point in lying like this? People act like his tweets are profound and responsible for his win. I can’t remember seeing one that wasn’t at best a non-factor but likely made him look ridiculous. Yeah it's a huge reason I think he needs to ditch twitter. It's only making him look reckless and ignorant. The lies are not helping anyone. He’d get re-elected easily based on the job he’s done. But he pisses it away because people hate the petulant teenage shit. By all means call out people at times. But everyday is the Festivus Airing of Greivances with him. Let alone the casual relationship with easily provable facts Let alone the casual relationship with easily provable factsExactly this. You can't effectively call out the fake news when you literally spout some out yourself. It's called hypocrisy. It's almost as if Trump is being Trump. He was elected being Trump and he will be re-elected being Trump.  I voted for him warts and all. I look at action above all else. And yet the nagging girlfriends of the Republican party can't stop complaining about Trumps words. You can read his Tweets the vast majority of them are on point and effective and yet every time he slips up people that yell the loudest and are almost silent when it comes to everything else he says.

Got 1 result. lolwut I think it’s fake Speaking of Duckduckgo anyone feel like their algorithm is different? The search results feel different to me recently.Edit: I was comparing current DuckDuckGo vs an older DuckDuckGo not Google but wasn't very clear. It feels like DuckDuckGo made some changes to their algorithm or something. I do not have to go to page 3 to find a Fox article on a subject with DuckDuckGo. Havent been using it long enough to comment on recent changes. Depends on the topic. Try finding a left leaning article about the January Bruce Ohr hearings or Clinton election meddling by that Ukranian guy. They are different but I do not trust Google at all. Honestly I only use Google at work but for everything else I use DuckDuckGo. Same here! I meant to say that recent DuckDuckGo seems different than it used to be but I wasn't very clear. Definitely way different than Google. If only all of Google's Advanced Search Operators transferred. The ""site"" operator is nice but used to use ""inurl"" and ""filetype"" a lot.If you're bored one day pick a random site or university and do a search for ""site:example.com filetype:xls"" you might be surprised. Maybe you guys should subscribe to the r/duckduckgo subreddit? It's a cool place. Subbed! I'd come across r/uBlockOrigin but not that sub yet. Thanks. Np It feels more literal. As in you get pages containing exactly the words you searched where Google is using AI to guess at your meaning.I use ddg as my default and if that fails I have a firefox extension that gives me a link to the Google search results. For example a good ddg search: ""python 3.6 docs"" - Google: ""why does ... make me feel ..."" Put !g in front of your search. No need to have a plug-in that you shouldn't trust. I just read the source code:var location = document.getElementsByClassName('js-search-filters search-filters')[0]; var searchQuery = document.getElementById('search_form_input').value; var link = document.createElement('a'); link.setAttribute('href' 'https://google.com/search?q='+searchQuery); link.setAttribute('target' '_blank'); link.setAttribute('rel' 'noopener nofollow noreferrer'); link.innerHTML = ""Google it"";location.appendChild(link);It just gets your search query and tags it on the end of a Google search link. That's literally it. It is really convenient to get straight to websites from your search bar and works for thousands of sites.!w is wikipedia!a is amazon!twitter is twitter!brownells is brownells Good to know. I'm glad you are able to view the source. suspect.. When I do a search one of the first links is always a Reddit link which started happening after I used the site:reddit.com feature a few times. Sites I've visited seem to now be ranked higher in search results. Feels like they're being ""tailored"" to me which is why I dropped Google to begin with. Eh who knows. You don’t need an extension to get google results just use the bang fonction of DuckDuckGo. E.g: typing « !g Hillary is a tranny » on ddk will give you the google search results. DuckDuckGo is more privacy centric and google's search algorithm is kept under lock and key so it's not like they can use they exact same one. Their search algorithm sucks i used it for three months and finally switched backed. Yeah. It isn't nearly as advanced as google's so for non political research it is leaps and bounds ahead of duck duck go in most cases.",0,False,t3_b8hin4,36,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b8hin4/what_google_and_duckduckgo_thinks_of_mueller/,511,,What google and duckduckgo thinks of Mueller.,511,https://imgur.com/Zq1QMM6

IronWolve,"Well that gets ride of the incentive to illegally come here and have children. Birth right citizenship was never supposed to apply to the children of Illegal aliens. It should absolutely be thrown out. Looks like the time to fight the 14th define it better is upon us This is really the best way. Congress is obviously not going to take up the issue. So POTUS should pass an executive order let it get challenged in court and let the Supreme Court decide on what the 14th should actually mean and whom it applies to. One of SCOTUS's main jobs is to interpret the constitution. Birthright citizenship has to end. Exactly. It wasn’t meant for illegals to dig holes and force their children under our wall. The immigrants this was put into place for worked for people who came here and contributed to our economy and society. It can’t be a “free for all”. If that happens America will be no different than Mexico or any similar country. There is zero reason for Jus Soli citizenship at this point. The 14th was never intended to provide a backdoor for illegals 150 years later. Originally it was intended to provide citizenship to the recently freed slaves. Really needs repealed at this point and all citizenship should be jus sanguinis or naturalization of LEGAL immigrants. Its pretty clear that the intention of birthright citizenship wasnt to give it to anyone who happens to be whelped out while there parents are in country temporarily Should have done it 2 years ago. Birthright citizenship doesn’t apply to children who are born to foreign diplomats while in our country....so how the hell does it apply to illegals? I believe and correct me if im wrong but but there are a ton of countries that enforce this rule today and have done so for a long time. That being born in a country does not tie you to that right. It's the difference between ius soli and ius sanguinus. Most countries have blood citizenship but not the states. I dont think he can change it on his own. He would need to repeal the 14th and for that a convention is needed. I’m okay with that. I’m also okay with never giving DACA people citizenship and sending them back. I’ve never been given a pass on the laws for anything be it ignorance or otherwise. I was empathetic before I’m not now. Let’s hope he can push this through. Enough of this idea that America is candy land for the world without following our immigration procedures. Hopefully the Supreme Court will here this and we can enforce this as the 14 amendment reads! But he won't and the millions that are here will stay here because nothing changes Sad but true. I'm getting sick of his ""I might have to shut down the border"" tweets too. That talk was good on the campaign trail but it's far past time to put up or shut up. Until Trump. He has no political agenda. He still has to jump through all the hoops and whistles but he is working his ass off for the American people. If anyone can make lasting changes he can. Trump 2020. Riiiiight.  He's changed the game on the border and we will deport millions. Hopefully so. Maybe more homeless veterans would have jobs instead of illegal cheap labor. A girl can dream... Not gonna happen.  Nothing really changes Bluuuh go back to bed in your dark room with your dark thoughts. Realistic thoughts.  This administration will end with the same fundamental problems as the last: millions here illegally rapidly increasing debt and no concrete results to actually make headway on either.

CosmicWarrior_PCMR,Time for a shower Something that kinda bothered me yesterday was the local conservative talk radio was defending Biden. One show even brought up how he gropes little kids but they were like well he's from the old school generation when grabbing a woman and doing whatever you want is fine. I can't listen to Dana Lash now bc of how much she was defending him (I think that's her last name). Sometimes for both...Dinos and Rinos what they want is someone who will not rock their boat who will keep the money as it is. For them the known quantity of Biden is better than than Trump. Just like for someone like Pelosi or whatever no matter what they say someone like Trump is better for their business. They knew Bernie could beat Trump. They wanted Hillary who would keep their money humming but also were ok enough with Trump.establishment democrats ( not the rank and file) would rather lose to Trump than win with Bernie. They are desperate to get annnnyone in that will play their kind of ball. I don’t know of the radio show you are speaking of personally but regular radio wants mainstream candidates. another thing is that let’s be honest a WHOLE LOT of men that age were likely heinie pinchers and are thinking of all the...questionable behavior in thier closets. I can’t even count the number of times I was assaulted as a young working woman. Countless times. So many. It was the way of it and I didn’t like it but I knew who had the power and it wasn’t me.

ReaganTroll,The U.S. private sector added 129000 jobs in March according to the ADP National Employment Report released Wednesday well below expectations.Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal were expecting the addition of 173000 jobs.The March additions to private payrolls were down from a seasonally adjusted 197000 jobs added in February according to payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody’s Analytics.Medium-size businesses or firms that employ between 50 and 499 workers added 63000 jobs. Small businesses with 49 or less employees added 6000 while large businesses or those with more than 500 employees added 60000.“The job market is weakening with employment gains slowing significantly across most industries and company sizes. Businesses are hiring cautiously as the economy is struggling with fading fiscal stimulus the trade uncertainty and the lagged impact of Fed tightening” Moody’s Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi said in prepared remarks.Most of the new private-sector jobs came from the service sector especially employees hired in health and education as well as in professional and business services. The service sector gained 135000 jobs in March the report showed. However that was offset by a loss of 6000 jobs in the goods-producing sector.The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its nonfarm job numbers on Friday.

Perfect_Gas,"Can someone provide some info on what's happening with Flynn? He lied to the FBI about what he talked about with Russian ambassador Kislyak and plead guilty to it. His story didn’t remain exactly the same each different time they interviewed him. The farther out from a specific event you get the less you remember. Even the anti trump FBI agents that interviewed him and later had to be removed from the investigation for their anti trump bias said they don’t believe he lied. He pleaded guilty because he was left bankrupt by the investigation and Mueller was going to attempt to do the same to Flynn’s son. I've read that it's even more fucked than that. The FBI had secretly recorded the meeting about which they were questioning him. What he talked about was according to Ken Starr ""completely appropriate"" given the role he would have with the White House.However when the FBI agents questioned Flynn about what was said in that meeting his recollection didn't match up with the transcript they had. They also didn't tell him that they had a transcript. They also didn't even think he was lying. But they also didn't tell him he could be prosecuted for lying and he didn't have his lawyer with him when the FBI interviewed him.Somehow that's not a perjury trap apparently. But he was 100% set up by the FBI to get in trouble for lying. Never talk to the police.Especially the Feds. Agreed but he asked the FBI director (or deputy I can't quite remember) who told him explicitly that this wasn't a meeting were lawyers were needed. This was 100% the leadership of the FBI trying to take down the Whitehouse. When a cop tells you ""you don't need a lawyer"" or ""let's not get the lawyers involved"" you REALLY need a lawyer. I agree with you that's true in most contexts. The relationship is much different. I think it would be like a prosecutor asking a Chief if he needs lawyers present for what seems to be a completely normal meeting. Half the meeting was a tour of the whitehouse I think.Flynn was a director and a 4 star General. As much as caution is a good rule of thumb he didn't expect any of this and I don't think the FBI did either (based on their initial notes). Well the FBI certainly did because the FBI did it to him.  Maybe a few agents on the ground weren't kept in the loop but the bureaucracy as a whole absolutely knew what it was doing.What this entire multi-year affair has done is to likely permanently stain the reputation of the FBI and the Justice Department.  Zero interest in investigating or prosecuting Hillary despite numerous and quite obvious felonies but they went to the mat and beyond attempting to absolutely destroy Trump and his closest supporters.We no longer have a single set of laws for our nation.  We have two sets.  If you are part of the Democratic elite nothing will happen to you regardless of what you do.  If you are not then you are subject to the full force and fury of the law at a minimum and far worse if you are deemed to be an enemy by the Democratic elite. Maybe a few agents on the ground weren't kept in the loopNah I believe one of those agents was Strzok. Hmm... should I trust my lawyer for legal advice? Or the opposition? I agree with you that's true in most contexts. The relationship is much different. I think it would be like a prosecutor asking a Chief if he needs lawyers present for what seems to be a completely normal meeting. Half the meeting was a tour of the whitehouse I think. They were not the ""opposition"" at the time.Flynn was a director and a 4 star General (I believe). As much as caution is a good rule of thumb he didn't expect any of this and I don't think the FBI did either (based on their initial notes). It was Mccabe... You know the one who leaked i go then lied about it to investigators. Yes but you have to remember the timeline. I think Flynn should be pardoned don't get me wrong. But you have to think in context of what was going on at the time. Hindsight is 20/20. Im not saying Flynn should have been prosecuted I firmly believe that Flynn was cannon fodder for the people who wanted to present the russia narrative. I was just pointing out the irony that McCabe assisted in catching Flynn out with the same thing he got fired for (and claims innocence from.The kicker he leaked that the DOJ pushed him to close the Clinton foundation investigation in order to shake the claim that he was baught and paid for by the Clintons because he was one of the people deeply involved with wiretapping/spying on the Trump campaign as well as helping set up the special council investigation.Hes so deep in the shit his eyes are brown. Maybe we should protest this behavior and not just write on Reddit comments. Although then you run the risk of being labeled anti-american. Even more fucked up than that he wasn't fired and charged until after Andrew McCabe altered the 302 (interview notes made by the agents who conducted the interview) and deleted the history of the changes then leaked that altered 302 to Sally Yates.  Yates convinced the White House that Flynn was a possible blackmail target based on his having lied according to the altered 302. Oh yes. I forgot about that part. Somehow that's not a perjury trap apparently. But he was 100% set up by the FBI to get in trouble for lying.Oh it's a fucking perjury trap. Only the FBI would insist it wasn't. There is literally no such thing as a perjury trap. The guy got caught up in his web of lies just like most criminals. He was working on behalf of another government. And honestly what kind of idiot doesnt think their conversation with the FBI is going to be recorded in some way Entrapment is the word the poster above is looking for.“According to the FBI summary of the interview—known as a 302—Mr. McCabe and FBI officials “decided the agents would not warn Flynn that it was a crime to lie during an FBI interview because they wanted Flynn to be relaxed and they were concerned that giving the warnings might adversely affect the rapport.”We also know from then FBI Director James Comey that this was his idea. This is “something I probably wouldn’t have done or wouldn’t have gotten away with in a more organized administration” Mr. Comey boasted on MSNBC this weekend. “In the George W. Bush Administration or the Obama Administration if the FBI wanted to send agents into the White House itself to interview a senior official you would work through the White House counsel there would be discussions and approvals and who would be there. And I thought it’s early enough let’s just send a couple guys over.”” Entrapment really doesnt apply here either though. The guy was dumb enough to think he would skate by simply lying and got caught. It's really that simple If it was that simple he would be in jail right now.

2. Create a grievance class no matter how small in opposition to the foundational practices of the tradition.
3. Get organizations of influence usually professional bodies or government agencies to recognize the grievance class.
4. Create a plausible case that the practices of the grievance class are normal human variation and should be more tolerated. Suppress any discussion of potentially anti-social problems with the grievance class’ practices.
5. Convert the practices of the grievance class into a status. This is usually accomplished by claiming something innate and immutable about the grievance class.
6. Convert the discussion from one of toleration to one of rights.

chabanais,Narrator: it's not Narrator 2: Narrator 1 is right. Narrator 3: Narrator 2 is right. Abortion requires context IMO. I am pro-life with exceptions.If you are aborting your baby because you were careless and got pregnant by accident then that is not okay; however if you are aborting for a genuine health risk that is different. So here’s a second side to that genuine health risk story that I’m still unsure how to handle. I’m sharing mostly because maybe someone else can add something to help me square it away in my head. I’ve told this before but my sister-in-law is a nurse that handles cardiac related cases in a specialty wing at the med center here in town. One woman that she’s working the case on has a condition where the tissues of the veins and arteries shred under pressure. She was repeatedly told do not get pregnant the risk was far too high since pregnancy is stress on the body.This moron gets pregnant because she wanted a kid and it’s her life. Now there are two lives at high risk and the doctors have to figure out how to handle this case. A child will die because of her choice if the medical team can’t figure out how to help her. The lack of responsibility bothers me so I always look at the “incase of medical risk to the mother” and feel her choices will kill another. This one is tough. It sounds like both will die if the baby is not aborted.In this case I have a little empathy being told you cannot have children has to hurt. It does not justify going against doctors orders though. It’s so easy to get pregnant for most women I just wish there was a greater sense of reverence for the life produced where women and men were  more careful to protect and cherish it.

If you hate abortion or have an abortion every week see it.It's a pure flix film. For anyone who doesn't know they made Gods Not Dead and Gods Not Dead 2 and other amazing...experiences.This movie will be an experience for literally anyone.

They sound like MSNBC contributors.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/unplanned It was eye opening. What reality are they missing? Nobody is stoked for abortions but believing people should have that option is paramount to freedom. Also objectively the abortion argument is “should we force women to birth or not” believing people should have that option is paramount to freedom.Just not for the baby who is murdered amirite. Does a rock have a choice as to where it ends up? Are human beings the same as inanimate objects? A fetus is especially one with no brain function. It has no idea it even exists. You couldn’t ask it what it wants to do. “Hey there fetus you are gonna cause a lot Of issues for me and as your mother I’m think of ending it what do you think?” You ‘ll get no response I’m sure you are aware because it has no idea you even said anything. You think you are “speaking up for the little guy” but really you are just representing the oppression of reproduction. Stop acting like a fetus has  sentience. So an adult who was in a coma has no idea they exist is it okay to murder them? A fetus is especially one with no brain function. It has no idea it even existsNeither does a 2 day old baby.  So are you saying it's also ok to murder a 2 day old baby?  Just wondering where we draw the line here... A fetus has its first brain activity between 5-6 weeks. Fetus is just a stage in the development of a human being.You think you are ""speaking up for women"" but really you're just justifying the murder of inconvenient humans. My son's heart was thumping at 160 bpm during the first ultrasound (6 weeks). Brain development and function begins before that.

If my wife drank a sweet tea he would jump and twist all over the place. The whole sentient argument is so subjective and it doesnt make sense to apply that logic to someone who has lost their brain function (like chabanais mentioned). If the process isnt altered that fetus will develop its organs and it should already have the same rights as anybody that is out of their mothers womb. Literal only difference between being a fetus and a baby is 7 inches out of the uterus. Life is ultimately what should count as the moral beginning and to me life begins when brain function heart beating and lung function (6-8 weeks) begins. You could also make the moral argument that life begins at contraception because that is when the process begins. That is an odd argument for pro-abortion. Bravo. There's plenty of feminists that see abortion as empowering and A LOT of people that see it as no big deal when it's still a big medical procedure they can screw with your hormones and permanently damage your body. I lean pro-choice but I know several people that have PTSD from it No one is forcing women to give birth. They could have prevented it. I am fine with very early abortion and abortion in extreme circumstances but it shouldn't be the first option for people. Also objectively the abortion argument is “should we force women to birth or not”You have a weird definition of objectively. No one is forced to have unprotected sex barring cases of rape but that's not what happens in 99% of abortions.There are a myriad of contraceptive options out there and the use of abortion as a retroactive one is sick and irresponsible. Everyone wants to have sex but no one wants to deal with the consequences. This so much. The only reason for sex no matter how good it feels is to have a baby. The ultimate choice for any woman should be: should I have sex and risk having a baby before I am ready or should I abstain and have sex/a baby when I am ready? This is representative throughout most of the animal kingdom (certain species dont have sex to reproduce). Ultimately it is a lack of accountability that people have. The abortion argument is objectively ""should avoiding giving birth be an acceptable excuse for killing a human being"" And yet the pro-abortionist proudly parade their support for this practice with rainbow heart badges. Haven’t seen this movie but didn’t Abby Johnson change to pro life because she saw a baby try to avoid and “run away” from the abortionist? She said that she saw the baby “jump and try to get away” when the abortionist probed them with the tube used to dismember them. See if stuff like that goes on how in the hell could you say that isn’t a human being?

brad1098,"Funny how none of this came out when he was Obama's VP for 8 years. The Democrats are purposely sabotaging him so they can nominate one of their ultra-left crazies. Politics is so broken in this country. If certain people don't like your politics they'll destroy your reputation and life. Why would anybody in their right mind enter such a fray? This is all to wack him out of the primaries so they can run someone with more absurd policies.  He's no saint and he definitely is a creep but this is party politics and not some moral stand. Strategy is wise. He probably would get the nomination and Trump would murder him on the memes for this if it didn't kick him out now.People always said he was the best shot for being Trump but i knew his touchiness would get him in the end. Eh I'm not so sure he would. Shapiro had a pretty solid analysis today. He was having a lot come out against him (for pretty much anything) before these accusations happened. Even past policy will be probably too conservative for the base. This is all probably bullshit (very weird) but clearly just political. I don't know if he really had a chance. See not sure Trump would knock him out. Uncle Joe is the only one in Trumps weight class who could realistically win. I mean knock him out with the insults and nicknames regarding this.

LAfeels,"When they finally get the report they will feign shock and dismay that the classified parts are redacted. They will then demand a fully Declassified Mueller report.From here one of three things will happen:Our intelligence agencies will determine that the redacted parts are too sensitive to declassify in which case the Democrats will insist that those were the parts that prove Donald Trump was guilty.Our intelligence agencies release a fully uncensored report and the Democrats take a random part out of context knowing their voters won't read it. They'll use this as the jumping off point for a new narrative.Our intelligence agencies release a fully uncensored report and the Democrats will come up with a new story about how Donald Trump threatened our intelligence agencies to creating a phoney report that exonerates him.The Democrats accept the results of the report. They accept Donald J Trump is their president and decide that it's finally time to debate him on issues and not emotion. All current candidates are dumped in favor of non-racist moderate centrists. Hillary Clinton is tried for murder. Hell freezes over. Bernie Sanders sees the error of his ways and admits capitalism is ""a good ting"". Jesus returns and endorses Coke over Pepsi. Feels plausible The news cycle isn't working in their favor and they want any nugget of bad info on Trump that they can get to change the tide.  The current regulations dictate that certain information be redacted from the report and this takes time.  Subpoena or not--- Adam ""pencil dick"" Shiff (pronounced shit) and Nadler get to wait. Regulations they fought for in the first place Why not release the full report? I have to imagine that a report on a thorough investigation into Russian election interference is going to include a lot of sensitive and classified information on our intelligence gathering techniques and such. When and if they release the report I’d guess it’s going to be heavily redacted.With as much misinformation that’s been out there lately though I’d definitely like to see as much of it as possible You can't release grand jury information intelligence that might affect current counter intelligence efforts and information about people who were investigated but not charged should be kept secret.After 2 years of saying nothing should affect the Mueller probe you're not suggesting we fuck it all up? Depends on what you mean by 'the full report'.  It needs to be redacted.  For example if part of the report includes an interview with some guy who talked to Michael Flynn 10 years ago and the FBI discovered that guy cheats on his wife and said racist things about Eskimos  or whatever you can't just release that to the public if that guy isn't being accused of a crime.   It's probably illegal and certainly unethical.I think everybody wants to see the 'full report' minus the stuff that would be illegal/unethical to release. Because there is pending litigations and releasing grandjury evidence testimony is a crime? And quite likely classified information as well considering the amount of FISA warrants they used. Trump promised to release all of that after the report dropped then the real investigations can begin Even those documents would need to be redacted in some part. This. As much as I am on board with the transparency train I also think it would be an egregious breach of trust to publish potentially damaging testimony about private citizens who remain uncharged with a crime and no charges will ever be brought against them. Excluding any confidential information the report is probably still embarrassing for Trump.  Depending on how people nit pick and interpret the report could look bad for him. Based on the utter lack of confidence anyone should have about the media reporting for the past 2+ years we have no idea what the report will say. We do know how the democrats and democrat media will spin it though. I doubt anything in the report will hold up in court or an impeachment. Just use their language and accuse them of being ""bad faith actors"". They love that I see it all the time. It's their favorite excuse to ignore a conservative. Their Trump derangement syndrome compels then to believe the report will have anythingThey are making themselves look like total jackasses this entire Russia meme just handed Trump the 2020 race on a silver platter As much as I’d like to believe that I don’t think that’s the case. Leftists and people around me are simply doubling down.It is going to become extremely unsafe for conservatives especially maga supporters here very soon. Doubling down on a strategy that doesn’t work and is increasingly alienating more and more of the country.It may but that’s why we have the second amendment.

SuperCharged2000,They got it all wrong. It’s our pale ghoulish-looking skin that is causing climate change. The sun hits our pure white flesh and reflects it back into the atmosphere which reflects back onto our skin and the cycle repeats and results in an out of control greenhouse effect. The annihilation of all white Americans is the only way to solve climate change obviously. /s Don't give them any ideas. So the whole conclusion is based on the fact that white people are the majority.  So basically white people are polluting the planet by existing. Kill whitey!! That isn't even the case. Globally whites are a minority.  This is before you start looking at the actual study which is troubling to say the least.They start out comparing 25 food items for their impact and who eats them. Then cherry pick seven because doing the math for all 75 original combinations is apparently too difficult for them.  Then paper over how the entire 'Latinex' analysis is statistically insignificant.  Then dispense with any sort of statistical analysis for the remainder of the paper.  I for one would have really liked to see error bars in their final numbers. But since its a study that just uses other people's data the actual accuracy of any of their numbers is anybody's guess.The entire paper is premised on the assumption that you can draw a box around a 'white diet' a 'black diet' and a 'latin diet.'  Because you know we're all given our menu options at birth and rigidly stick to them our entire lives like automatons...

chabanais,"When 95% of those people crossing the border illegally start voting republican. We would have .50 caliber machine guns located every 50 ft along a 700 ft high border wall surrounded by a moat filled gasoline with bio engineered crocodiles that can survive in gas and are resistant to heat in case the gas has to be lit afire to stop the influx of the illegals. You mean like this?  https://imgur.com/a/4pqTMKu Funny but always remember that when leftists build walls lined with machine guns it's usually to keep people in instead of out. Trick question. They'll never admit it's an emergency. If all of South America walked over the border right now they would not call it an emergency. They would see 450 million new Democrat voters and welcome them When it’s directly impacting their daily lives ""What border?"" - Mad LibsYou can't have an emergency at a thing you don't recognize as existing. When they win back the office. The border will never be bad enough for the Democrats to admit there's an emergency.  That's an absolute fact without equivocation or hesitation.You could have ISIS smuggle a tactical nuke across the Mexican border and detonate it in NYC and the Democrats would still resist efforts to close our southern border. Democrats now consider that the border might be an emergency. The dems would have to think some of the illegals might vote conservative.  Then they would discover some moral outrage. The Dems need a Dem president in office before they make a show of cracking down on illegal immigration.What I would like to see from the Republican and Dem leadership is a crackdown on the employers of illegal immigrants but I won't hold my breath. It seems both parties want illegal immigration to remain and they both want to continue to allow someone a mysterious someone to continue employing illegal aliens. The Democrats AND the Republicans have done nothing about border security for decades. The Dems because they see 'poor brown people' and future voters and don't want to tick off their Hispanic voting base and the Republicans because so many influential agricultural industry people have bought them off.The Republicans had 2 years to approve the wall and did squat. Now we've got 100k people per month and the Dems are sitting on their hands because they think it makes Trump look bad. Well it doesn't. It's the Democrats who have refused to provide the Border Patrol with the money they need to house all these people which means they basically have to just let them go and hope they show up again for a hearing a year or two down the road.Best case scenario (and likeliest) is this gets worse and the word spreads then it becomes impossible to ignore as we head into an election year. Let's see how the ""No wall!"" bunch look when the rising tide of economic migrants causes a rising tide of anger from taxpayers.Mind you I'm not sure what good the wall would be as long as our laws say anyone who walks up to a crossing and claims to be a refugee has to be waved through. And that's the case now since the US has no place to house them and can't legally turn them away without a hearing. I really wish all this emergency stuff would have been dealt with in January/February 2017. Declaring it an emergency NOW clearly has bad optics. We should of steamrolled border control when we had the chance. Some people might downvote me for saying this but I think that  trump declaring a national emergency is a mistake whether or not it actually is a national emergency. When something is an emergency you declare it right away instead of waiting to see if the house/senate agree with you or not. Something should be done sure but I think he should've either went for it right away and at least make him seem more worried than he did or he should've not done it. Its just a bit of a power reach for the executive branch to be able to do that if he can just go against what congress wants. This situation can be applied no matter who is power keep in mind.

If the GOP actually ran a candidate with more airtime we wouldn’t have Cuomo. This will be Cuomo’s last term mark my words.I honestly don’t think the fed should be funding the SO. The $15M they received last year was from the fed but overall received ~$150M from donors and supporters. Realistically it makes sense to defund. Optically it makes sense to keep the fed involved Cuomo is making NYC pay half for the subway and the rest of the state takes the other half because “it benefits all of us.” Can someone fucking explain to me how a subway in NYC benefits someone in Williamsville? Fuck this guy. “There’s a pothole that needs to be fixed on your street but the subway in New York is nice” doesn’t have the same ring to it. They need to bury it in a larger slash-and-burn. And Trump even said he was going to fund it anyway. 40% raise for Cuomo.  They also cut funding to the emergency snow fund for upstate you know that gets shutdown by snow at least twice a year. Had to check that one. SourceIn their final moments of approving the New York State budget early Monday morning state lawmakers signed off on a series raises for Gov. Andrew Cuomo which – barring another state raising the pay of their chief executive – make Cuomo the highest paid governor in the United States.Cuomo’s salary will jump to $200000 this year and $250000 in 2021 reflecting an eventual 40% increase over his current $179000 annual pay.40 fucking percent oh my god LOL. Okay so let’s get this straight. New York’s budget shits itself so badly they’re staring at a $2.3b hole. Cuomo says they need smart spending. People are worried about the amount of funding for upstate like you said or like direct cars workers or schools getting what they need and this motherfucker gives himself a 40% raise hahahaha. Oh my god that’s fucking hilarious. And none of the voters in NY will ever hear about this There is no federal enumerated power authorizing funding the Special Olympics. This should be kicked back to the states and people (private charity). Democrats once again show they support erosion of enumerated powers with their action to defund it and pass the buck to the federal government. Well coumo did just get a raise  so something had to give. Holy crap.Not that I’m surprised. The government shouldn't be funding the Special Olympics. It doesn't benefit the vast majority of taxpayers. Minus the fact that Cuomo has changed his mind He just looks like an evil bot Lets not forget that 3 people are drafting the NYS budget no one else is able to weigh in on the matter and tax dollars is being allocated to pay for campaigns as well.But NYC never learns they had years of a corrupt Cuomo and they elected another one.

Good luck getting elected on the truth namely we need to either substantially reduce benefits substantially increase taxes or some combination of the two in order to compensate for decades of feckless spending. What about the Trillion a year in military spending Reductions in military spending could have a part but they pale in comparison to outlays for Medicare in particular. You guys pay more per capita for Medicare than we pay for universal healthcare up here in Canada. Now we have our own problems but I think it's clear the US's medical insurance system needs an overhall. Just throwing this out there Canada has a population of roughly 35 million the US roughly 350 million. That is 10 times the population. Plus the only way to make socialized healthcare work is through fixing price sheets of hospitals and doctors. Like he said per capita. You are right in a sense though about fixing price sheets of hospitals and doctors except you have to add pharmaceutical companies in there too and all the people going to emergency rooms with no ID to get treated.In my mind and I believe myself to be fiscally conservative we do need to regulate the corporations like the pharmaceutical companies or mega hospital corporations (asante) from charging 10000% mark up on whatever they want.That and we would have to overhaul our judicial system since most regular doctors can’t even afford malpractice insurance. and all the people going to emergency rooms with no ID to get treated.This is a huge issue that people don't talk about enough. Well the impasse is clear. The beauty of a free market system is competition which should regulate price but the collusion of providers and hospitals and pharma companies remove the check and balance of completion. I won’t ever endorse regulations which dictate how much someone or something can charge for their goods or services that’s not the right path. Instead regulate the collusion within the medical industry. Like if your medicine costs over “$X.XX” you cannot have a exclusive IP patent that lasts more than two years so that generics can be made. Regulate the judicial system that pays out exorbitant settlements for medical malpractice. Reduce the burden of malpractice insurance that is forcing doctors to charge 15000 dollars for 15-20 minutes of work. Medical schools all receive federal money so regulate how much they can charge for tuition if they still want federal money for their schools. The list of things to mitigate costs and retain a free market are myriad. Also the math of the cost per capita doesn’t scale proportionately so ten times the people doesn’t qualify a strait line ten fold increase in costs. The logistics alone would consume far more and thus the per capita cost for social healthcare here in the US would still remain vastly higher than Canada even if identical regulation were used. I'm not sure I'm seeing your argument on how a larger population would need to cost more per capita than a smaller population? A hospital that serves 100000 people should cost the same to operate regardless of how many other hospitals there are in the country. In terms of the cost of manufacturing drugs and medical devices canada already gets most of our drugs and equipment from US companies so that shouldn't be any different. If anything economies of scale mean it should be cheaper for larger quantities.The fact of the matter is we have so much more coverage for less. I just graduated uni and am still in the trial period at my job which means I don't have any private health coverage. Right now I have to pay out of pocket for things like dental and minor prescriptions but if I got cancer or needed surgery I wouldn't have to pay for anything.If I were in that same position in the states I would probably be in debt for the rest of my life. The U.S pays roughly double what everyone else pays per capita for healthcare (even when purchasing power adjusted).That's per capita including the people that don't have insurance at all so it's actually more than double per insured person.Yes delivering health insurance to rural areas is a difficult logistical problem. There isn't the density there to support doctors and frankly doctors just do not want to live in those areas.But more than double. Really? I mean that's just a shit deal for Americans.We can do better. We need to do better. Or rework the patent system to prevent government granted pharmaceutical monopolies. Per capita accounts for the pop difference That's should make it cheaper cause you know economies of scale So question because I’m actually curious. Would you be open to a single-payer system if it reduced the spend on healthcare overall? USA = a giant insurance company with a great military. The military is currently around 720B a year which while very high is still less than we spend on either healthcare or social security aka wealth redistribution. Military spending is a huge economic driver in the US. You cut government spending there say goodbye to great paying jobs at all the defense manufacturers. Plus the constituents that lose their jobs will be voting out everyone in their district so you know every politician will be fighting to keep them. You can make this argument about literally any government spending though. Yea you can that’s why it’s hard to cut. Really hard. SpendLessOnCandles.jpg $700 billion not $1 trillion. Also why would you cut spending on the most important function of the federal government? That's our third highest cost. Given the aggressiveness of China""s recent military expansion I think it makes more sense to try to reign in our two biggest costs a bit first. Those are rookie numbers you gotta pump those numbers up /s Start with the largest programs and work your way down. Medicare and social security are the obvious programs to cut. We'll reduce it when other countries stop depending on us for protection. Right now we are subsidizing them and Russia China and the Middle east are still huge threats we must content with.  For now we need to reduce welfare spending which is unpopular because FREE shit. Could spend less on military for starters... Yep. Someone has to be an adult and say ""no"" Slash it slash it slash it.-Ron Swanson Pawnee IL **Pawnee IN The first lesson of economics is scarcity: There is never enough of anything to satisfy all those who want it. The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics.- Thomas Sowell Someone we ended up with a GOP that’s bad at both. just look at the fallout over the Special Olympics. When you’re only left with the options of tax and spend politics vs. don’t tax and still spend politics frankly voting republican is the worst option at this point. Ehhh at least Republicans (generally) understand that less regulation is a boon to the economy. They suck regarding taxation but ensure the GDP is growing decently offsetting some of the tax losses. Still a terrible look for them but not the worst option. 🙄🙄 The two options you gave kind of go hand in hand. How can you spend if you don’t tax? And taxing without spending is probably just corruption. I’d like to hear of an option where the government spends without taxing. It’s called deficit spending. It's called the last two years. Seriously. Very true. It’s incredibly easy to start spending more but to spend less inevitably pisses people off that have adapted to having endless government subsidy. >The problemNo a problem.> Where are the REAL conservative in our government?That's a question most voters of Republican representatives are asking for an answer to. They went away as the party cozied up more and more with religious jackasses. The Republican Party has become the party of “increase spending less than the Democrats” rather than the party of actually spending less. Both are moving in the same direction one is slower than the other. Lower taxes and increase spending. Uh maybe other Republican administrations yes but this one just asked for the biggest budget in history ever didn't they? I completely agree although acting like this is one party’s problem over the others is disingenuous at best. Obama added more to the debt than all other presidents before him put together so it not a republican vs democrat problem it’s a politician problem. Politicians are only worried about getting re-elected and cutting spending isn’t popular with people who vote based on the “free” things people promise them. Bush added more to the debt than Clinton Obama added more than Bush Trump will add more than Obama and whoever is after Trump will add even more than him.To address the deficit you have to address entitlements because they are 70% of the federal budget. Before anything else is paid for 70% of all of our spending goes toward social security Medicare Medicaid and what is left of Obamacare. There aren’t enough cuts you could make in the remaining 30% of spending to address the issue in any meaningful way and that includes if you were to cut 100% of our defense spending. No politician will even consider touching entitlements because it is political suicide. Social Security shouldn't even be part of the budget imo. They just included it in the 90s to make their numbers look better.But you're totally right. The politicians argue about the tiny discretionary spending like NASA and don't even touch the real problem. Interest payment on the existing debt is another big one too that is automatic and will only grow. Social Security shouldn't even exist in the first place. In a perfect world it shouldn't but it seems to be one of the few government programs that is actually effective. The poverty rate for senior citizens has been consistently low compared to pre-SS days. How much of social security and Medicare payouts come from income tax revenue as opposed to social security and Medicare withholdings do you know? I don’t know I’m just jumping in here but I’m pretty sure all of social security and Medicare spending come from witholdings don’t they? By withholding a we’re talking about that large portion of our checks that are  taken out under ss and Medicare. I believe the govt takes none of that from income tax. But i could be wrong. The whole point of paying in was that it was supposed to be funded completely from those payments. Which works for all private sector pensions it’s awfully funny that it doesn’t work for the public sector. Or just further proves the government sucks.ROR on social security for the average person is like 1.3% in my opinion i would rather do away with it completely and fund my 401k with that money.I’ll also state that I’m not 100% sure on how ssi is funded but it seems like a shit deal when you work out the numbers.Edit: after a quick google just about all funding is from the workers and employers a small amount is from interest and an even smaller amount is from the general fund. So literally the government takes the money mismanages it and gives us a poor return. Insurance companies running pensions manage better ROR even while charging ridiculous fees. Just another prime example of the government being inefficient. No I am not sure but I know that a married couple that retires at normal retirement age and lives an average lifespan collects 1/3 more in social security benefits than they paid into the system. A similar couple that retired in 1980 would have collected almost three times what they paid in.https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/feb/01/medicare-and-social-security-what-you-paid-what-yo/ While i do think that social security is in part a Ponzi scheme you should probably include that it's at least partially due to the fact that those that retired in 1980 grew up partially in a time before social security existed. It's in the very paragraph you pulled your figures from. Tackling mandatory spending programs requires a supermajority of people with backbones. Whether right or left we have few of such people. Republicans are largely spineless. We have some like Gowdy and Paul but they never seem to do a whole hell of a lot. Genuine question what exactly does reducing / eliminating the debt do for the economy? His spending and the fact that he hasn’t taken us out of these foreign wars/conflicts are my two biggest criticisms of him. He’s great on pushing back on this PC crap and he’s done well for the US economy so far but I really want him to turn his direction around in spending and foreign intervention. Same. It's pretty sad how he's been scared to touch spending. He can't really do much with an obstructionist Republican and now Democrat congress. Most of the spending is now mandatory which means Congress doesn't get to say if they can spend it or not. They already promised it and getting Medicare / Social Security reform passed is basically impossible.This is the danger of pyramid scheme social programs. There's no such thing as a temporary government program nor a free lunch.Social Security isn't a ""safety net"" if everyone gets to jump into it. Congress can change the 'mandatory' spending laws at any time. That's just a word politicians use to avoid accountability and leftists use to avoid cutting their favored spending programs. Just treat it like it was originally intended and make it so that you only receive it after you've passed average life expectancy. Most of the spending is now mandatory which means Congress doesn't get to say if they can spend it or not.LOL where did you hear that? Congress has supremacy with spending they can legislate over this expenditure ANY TIME THEY LIKE.The problem is your legislature in the US doesn't really act like a legislature by....you know...legislating. Also he’s been lying to everyone saying that the economy is the greatest it’s ever been. The economy has changed very little from Obama’s and hardly has had better growth or sustainable growth compared to Obama’s. It’s very likely that it could crash soon and be blamed on him and his dirty “capitalism” allowing goofball socialists like Bernie or Warren to take control. That is complete bullshit. Interest rates have raised 7 basically 8 times under Trump and he still got great growth. Raising rates naturally slows the economy and he managed to get higher GDP than Obama in this environment. That’s pretty damn impressive in my opinion. The 0% interest rates from Obama still haven’t been liquidated. Powell stopped raising rates because he knows the economy would crash if he continued. The economy NEEDS to crash in order to get rid of all the fake wealth created by the feds stimulus but Trump is unwilling to do so because he’s worried about political backlash. The longer we wait to do so the more likely it will be to pop unexpectedly and the worse it will be for everyone. It’s not just Trump it’s everyone. No one wants to be the one responsible for crashing the economy.I agree with you though I wish we had not bailed out the banks in 08 and went into a Depression. I think we’d  be better off now.I’m bias though as I’m 29 and young. I was 18-19 during the Recession and was young enough to power through it. Now I’ve got a good job and housings is expensive again plus I get to hear about the constant threat of another recession. Yeah with economic indicators beginning to show a recession in the next 18 month that spells trouble for the conservative movement especially with leader who has never been a principled conservative. Yeah account with no history active in r politics! I'm sure you mean it and aren't a concern troll!Beep boop $0.02 have been placed in your account. Here my account has 7+ years of history.As a FORMER Republican I have been incredibly disappointed that Donald Trump and the Republican Party merely chant that they want to lower the deficit and debt. It is incredibly annoying now that they constantly run around pointing at anyone that isn’t an “R” and claiming they are overspending without looking inward at themselves... I still hope that one day the Republican Party will go back to what it use to mean. 100% this.  i hate fake conservatives calling out “liberal spending” when its very clear the GOP is just as much to blame.seriously someone needs to get a grip on this insane spending. Beautifully put are the mods going to ban you for this now though? Eliminating the debt is impossible and Trump knows that. Right now he’s doing everything he can to keep the dollar from collapsing. Secondly nobody wants to end the deficit. Trade deficit encourages other nations to lend us money. Money that we desperately need. Way less than 8 months. You're looking at 3-4 months. The US spends $7.5 trillion a year. Overall yes that’s what government spends. However the federal gov only spent 4.1 trillion in 2018  per the management and budget office And the left bitch about Trump wanting $5B Maybe that’s because the entire wall would cost at least 10 times that much. 5 billion is just a small start. That’s still almost half of what it cost to maintain Illegal Immigrants every year. Considering well over half of all illegal immigrants enter the country legally it's still a losing proposition for anyone capable of basic math. I’ll let Crowder do the talking for this one. There are a few problems with this video. I know you probably won't read this but I'll lay some of it out anyway.To preface: illegal immigration isn't a black or white thing. A lot of people are emotionally invested with it so that creates a lot of bias with it. I'm just going to talk about how this specific video is not a good source at all and I'm gonna try to keep it objective.This video fails to mention how a vast majority of people coming across the southern border are coming in through legal ports of entry (San Diego/Tijuana El Paso/Ciudad Juárez Matamoros Reynosa Mexicali I could go on and on). Hardly anyone is walking across the desert and climbing over a fence. Yea it happens but it's not $50 billion worth of people. Everyone sees these videos of people climbing over a fence and they get so freaked out about it but the truth is that people physically climbing over the fence is actually very uncommon. In the time it took them to scale that fence dozens more could have been smuggled across the border hiding in cars along the ports of entry. So many more people are coming in through the border points hiding in cars or trucks etc. It's the easiest way to do it and even if they get caught they can try again the next day because the Mexican court doesn't do a good job of prosecuting human smugglers.at 4:45 he's just kind of saying stuff without proving a source or expanding his argument.many [immigrants] are coming here and they're taking more than they're givingThis has been looked into a lot of times. So many people tend to believe that illegal immigrants hurt the economy more than they help but looking into it this economics professor (and many more) disagree with that. Illegal immigrants actually DO pay their taxes a lot of the time. In 2015 alone people without Social Security Numbers (which means that excludes legal immigrants permanent residents and those with a green card) have paid more than $23 billion in income taxes according to the IRS.Illegal immigrants also provide benefits with their extremely cheap labor. Because of the fact that they are illegal undocumented workers labor laws don't apply to them. Companies can pay them piss poor wages and they aren't going to complain about it. You ever wonder why those strawberries only cost you a few dollars? It's because hispanics working 80 hour weeks making nothing. According to CBSA study commissioned by the dairy industry suggested that if federal labor and immigration policies reduced the number of foreign-born workers by 50 percent more than 3500 dairy farms would close leading to a big drop in milk production and a spike in prices of about 30 percent.~5:20: He starts talking about how so many people are leaving Mexico because it's such a shitty country etc and obviously to a degree he isn't wrong. By American standards Mexico really is a shitty place and on Mexican standards America is a much more fantastic nation. But Mexico's economy has come an extremely far way since the 1960s. Mexico's economy is in the top 20 in the world with a GDP of $1.15T (PPP is $2.45T) and looking at this graph you can really see how their economy has exploded recently. Less people are leaving Mexico because it's becoming a better place with poverty levels decreasing and consumer spending increasing rather than because so much of their population has already left the country.It's kind of silly to assume that just because 11 million of them have already crossed the border over the entire history of illegal immigration that means less of them will try to cross in the future. There's no logical or factual backing to that. I mean there's still 110+ million Mexicans that could potentially cross the border whenever they want to. Crowder got the stagnation of illegal immigration across the border completely wrong.I got a few of my arguments from this documentary PBS did and I recommend you watch it too. It was made back in 2008 before a huge border wall became a real subject of debate. Obviously some of the figures there are outdated but the general arguments and ideas are still relevant. And only the half of it focuses on the border so it should only take 27 minutes to get through.The situation at the border is entirely too complex for a wall to even make a dent in illegal immigration numbers. This analysis by the Center for Immigration Studies determined that the cost of stopping even some illegal immigrants with a border wall would easily outweigh the wall's costs. All other financial estimates of illegal immigration's drains on the economy that I've seen back this up.Further this doesn't even address the human cost of illegal immigration - every American citizen killed by someone who shouldn't have been in this country is a death that shouldn't have happened.

How is this not hurting us?  They only put that amount of taxes back when they buy products not taxes like everyone else.Illegal immigrants also provide benefits with their extremely cheap labor. Because of the fact that they are illegal undocumented workers labor laws don't apply to them. Companies can pay them piss poor wages and they aren't going to complain about it.

That really says a lot about you.

Educate yourself before you talk. Maybe that’s because the entire wall would cost at least 10 times that muchNo estimates of the wall cost are anywhere near 50B. The highest legitimate estimates are 21.6-25 billion.5 billion is one half of ONE PERCENT of our current budget. 0.5% Sheep are to be shorn not skinned.-- Emperor Tiberius on taxation The problem is that we spend too much on late-in-life entitlements and not enough investing in our youth.  If we address both at-risk populations simultaneously one will take care of the other within a couple decades and we'll be a much stronger nation for it.

Sola__Fide,If she'd shut her mouth the reduction in hot air alone would offset the cow flatulence One of the worst parts is that she probably could make a case for that with some scientific validity and proposals worth looking at if she put in the work to do it. Is methane an important greenhouse gas? Do reputable agricultural researchers have testable ideas on how to change animal feed to alter gas formation without harming the animals or land and not costing too much? There might be something there. We don't know. If she sat down and made an effort to talk to the people who do know some about it she could determine whether this was worth bringing up and if so what specifically we'd want to try. Instead she just spews out whatever she thinks with little to no supporting evidence and expects everyone to fall in line because she won an election. It's extremely unconvincing and she undermines her own arguments. I won't claim to be an expert but methane is definitely a very potent greenhouse gas. Its concentration is very low and I wouldn't know how meaningful its emissions are compared to a much more prevalent gas like say carbon dioxide.I certainly don't trust Ocasio-Cortez to offer a realistic argument for the pros and cons of methane reduction of any type. I'm not sure who I even would trust here. Yes! That's the right way to look at the problem and whether or not it's important. IIRC methane was partly responsible for the high pressure and maintaining the high temperature of early Earth but I might be getting some of that mixed up. If the low concentration still makes a difference and it can be changed by adding something simple and safe to the feed let's try that in one area and see how it works out. Without a thorough examination of the concentration/change data and possible changes to make it's pointless to push thoughtless changes about it. How come nobody mentions chem trails when talking about the environment? That stuff has to be terrible for everything. Chem trails are usually water vapor caused by the low pressure side of airplane wings at cruising altitude. They're literally man made clouds. The emissions put out by planes are usually clear. What about the barium? Had to do a bit of searching to find what you meant by that. Found the article I think you're referencing.While I have no idea the one scientist that brought up the barium thing said he doesn't either one theory I would put forward is this: barium is often used in fireworks. Fireworks get launched into the sky then explode right? This could potentially leave a sizeable cloud of barium that could migrate as a unit instead of dispersing. It may be that fireworks where launched in the area that the sample was taken from or nearby causing the increased levels of barium in the atmosphere.Far fetched I know but a theory nonetheless. From what I was reading. There is quite a good amount my concern is it getting into the soil water which will then get into the food and ingested. I could be totally wrong  but it kind of makes sense. How about human flatulence? from my cold dead cheeks. I mean sure global warming is all a farce and there’s no way in hell that 100 companies are heating the up the planet causing nearly apocalyptic weather inconsistent temperature patterns the polar caps melting animals dying air quality lowering or anything...

Just like college students that live in dorms and choose to leave once they are done get to vote so do I. When I saw that stat the first time I recalled that 538 always talks about the 'self sorting' phenomenon in the US. It was interesting to see some concrete data put to the theory that we are moving to areas that are politically favorable to their own views. I'd bet the same holds true for people who move to deep blue states. As a native Texan please change how you vote or please stay in CA. We don’t want you. Tell the natives to stop voting for Robert https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign-polls/415932-exit-poll-more-native-texans-voted-for-orourke-than-cruz As a NY resident who will be seriously considering a move to Texas I will be not only voting the same way I have been: BLUE BABYI’ll also be making it a point to greet my neighbors introduce myself tell them I am from NY but the one thing I didn’t bring with me was NY.I need to get out of this commie state.Edit: There was supposed to be a “/s”These veins run Red baby You got out of the commie state to vote blue in Texas and make that place a commie state? Fuck. Lmao.I meant to put a /s after “BLUE STATE” hahahaSorry! My downvotes are well deserved for that one! I fucking hate this! In the last 2 years my property taxes have skyrocketed thanks to these cocksuckers! And know San Antonio is the 2nd most liberal city next to Austin. Please don't say that. I plan on moving to San Antonio in the next few years. Still a great city and I welcome you but the liberal pretense is sickening. You saw our city council just voted to not allow Chick-fil-A  in the airport because they donate to “hate groups” aka Salvation Army. San Antonio's real problem seems to be apathy. Less than 12% turnout got you guys Nirenberg. Damn spreading their rot :/Well you haven't caught up to Orwell's UK yet! Youre complaining about your property value increasing? Or have they just raised taxes? Propriety values mean nothing if you’re priced out of your home. Raised taxes hurt those that pay them. Saying otherwise is a limousine liberal response and really makes people hate the person spouting such ignorance. Liberal social policies suck ass and bring cancerous sores that infest the places they settle and liberals don’t respect individual liberty speech or gun rights.Does that explain it better? No lol you didn’t answer my question and went off on an irrelevant rant about liberals. If theyre coming and raising taxes that sucks. But if theyre coming and you end up paying more in taxes bc the property value increases if it’s more than you want to pay you can just sell and make a huge profit You don’t understand the situation. That has been made clear by this response. People don’t want to move or leave their homes like that. Many people don’t. I understand it perfectly. You and your community have an opportunity to make tens maybe hundreds of thousands in profits and you’re like “naw we can’t be having that” That’s a stunted view. People moving in isn’t a problem. Liberals fleeing the hellholes they have created and bringing the bad with them is the problem.Your welcome to move leave the cancer. If you can’t stay the fuck out.

DH5650,Maybe it was Home Economics. Hold your tongue sir! Home Econ holds a lot of valuable skills like cooking planning house keeping and sewing. All under-appreciated skills until you have company over and realize you’re a slob that can’t keep your habitat clean or inviting.Economics produced Crazy-Eyes by itself. You're right.  She belongs with the doe-eyed theoretical not the downright daily practical.Still it's hard to imagine her passing Macro- and Micro- with that math.  At least back in the day. Says a lot about the university that produced her. Hard classes wash people out. If she got through...well...UMB must suck Could be - anyone with a Home Ec degree would know you don't spend $7 for a croissant! Is this fake? Or an April fools thing? Don't get stung by the Babylon Bee (it's satire). she came to lose jobs and chew bubble gum.....and she doesnt know how to chew bubble gum... In all seriousness it is an indictment of post-secondary education in the US that she has a degree in economics. She doesn't even understand how a tax incentive works. As someone who teaches (part-time) at a public university I can tell you that most of the students will be naively unqualified by the time they graduate.

chabanais,"""Is the pope catholic?"" used to be a rhetorical question. I always preferred 'does a bear shit in the woods?' There have been worse popes in the past - for instance post-WWII it's probable that the Church ran ratlines that helped Nazis escape.That being said in recent memory Francis is far and away the worst.  To have an open socialist in the Papacy so soon after John Paul II is an indication of how far the Church has fallen. I always felt he was chosen because they wanted to avoid an obvious schism that is on the horizon as he was the “moderate” option. Now he’s done this and Europe has taken a hard turn I can almost expect the next one to be the polar opposite. I guess we should send all of them his way and see how fast he changes his tone. Fake Pope. :(We need a Pope that cleans house. The irony being that no one votes for war; they're just dragged into wars by lying politicians who use war for exfiltrating public funds into private holdings they've got stakes in.  No everyman capitalist says ""oh boy lets rob the government and kill people overseas for profit.""  Only crony politicians and war profiteers do that shit.  Most capitalists just want to honestly operate in markets to provide goods and services in exchange for transactional wealth. But whoever has the world’s goods and sees his brother in need and closes his heart of compassion against him how does the love of God remain in him? – 1 John 3:17 He who works his land will have abundant food but he who chases fantasies lacks judgment. - Proverbs 12:11Turns out that socialism is a fantasy.

ReaganTroll,The Administrative Procedure Act is intended to ensure regulatory due process but Democrats have weaponized the law to entrench Obama Administration diktats that do the opposite. Witness a judge’s order last month reinstating a payroll sweep that has left employers scrambling.The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has long required employers under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to file confidential reports including the number of individuals employed by job category sex race and ethnicity. But liberals say the government needs more data to patrol discrimination and pay disparities.Ergo the EEOC in 2016 mandated reams of pay data and planned to publicize the information by industry and geography. The new report form required employers to enumerate employee demographics by pay-band—e.g. female Hispanic assistants earning between $50000 and $80000—and increased the data points 20-fold.A Chamber of Commerce survey projected direct compliance costs would be some $400 million—far more than the EEOC’s $50 million estimate. Employers also warned that reconfiguring software would be cumbersome and provide little insight into pay disparities without information such as workers’ experience education and prior salary.The EEOC’s response: Who cares? While the agency said employers would benefit by comparing their worker pay to their peers the big beneficiaries would be liberal groups and plaintiff attorneys fishing for lawsuits. Although the EEOC would supposedly only publicize aggregate data employer-level data could be obtained from the Labor Department’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.Here’s the kicker: Only after the rule was sent to the Office of Management and Budget for final approval did the agency release the form’s data file specifications. The EEOC data demand thus appears to have violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA).Enter the Trump OMB which in 2017 suspended the data collection. The PRA says OMB may review collection when “relevant circumstances have changed or the burden estimates provided by the agency at the time of initial submission were materially in error” or there is “good cause.” The agency had plenty. As OMB explained the Obama EEOC’s “burden estimates did not account for the use of these particular data file specifications” and the “continued collection of this information is contrary to the standards of the PRA” among other things.The National Women’s Law Center sued arguing it would be harmed by being deprived of data to identify pay disparities though the data had never been collected. This is hardly a concrete and demonstrable injury the standard for legal standing.Yet federal Judge Tanya Chutkan an Obama appointee ruled that the Trump Administration violated the APA and PRA. According to the judge OMB’s “reasoning lacked support in the record” and ignored the impact on liberal groups. This is a textbook case in how liberal judges contort the APA to bring Obama regulations back from the dead.Perhaps preoccupied the Justice Department hasn’t appealed the ruling or asked for a stay though the judge has ordered employers to comply by next month. Justice needs to move pronto and let employers—the real victims of the Obama regulatory overreach—present their case to the courts.,0,False,t3_b8kziw,1,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b8kziw/an_obama_zombie_returns_a_case_study_in_how/,27,,An Obama Zombie Returns: A Case Study in How Liberal Judges Protect Regulatory Overreach,27,https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-obama-zombie-returns-11554159878

chabanais,"I keep waiting for the ""I believe her"" refrain to start back up on the left.Any day now.It'll come.Any time now. For thee but not for me. If it weren't for double standards the democrats would have no standards at all. I don't understand why people are acting all surprised about serial nuzzler Joe Biden's behavior.  It's been well documented on YouTube for years. Why are democrats given him a free pass to sexually assault people Double standards. Some of us don't look for that shit I certainly didn't notice until I think it was a T_D post about it I didn't look for it either but it's common knowledge that the guy is a creeper. It’s miraculous the lengths this site is going to suppress this story. EVERY SINGLE POST to /r/politics and /r/news is being bombarded by downvotes and suppression tactics. It’s pitiful how this site tries to hide the very real discord within the democrat party. These people created the metoo movement and are now reaping what they’ve sewn. Matter of fact the democrat party is wholeheartedly responsible for the weapon that’s been created. The metoo movement may have been created with great intentions in mind but when wielded like a political infinity sword it becomes a double edged weapon of chaos and destruction. What I witnessed during the Kavanaugh spectacle really struck me to my core. Nobody is safe in this day in age of social media and social justice. Emotions now precede facts. We actually have a sitting freshman senator who was quoted as saying that essentially “morality matters more than facts.” I just cannot wrap my head around that logic. That goes against the very foundation of being an American. Innocent until proven guilty. Right to a fair trial. We’re at a dangerous time in a country where we’re supposed to “believe all women.” Well now it’s tome for the democrat party and Joe Biden to put up or shut up. Will you acknowledge the weapon you’ve created or will you double down and meet your own creation in the field of battle? Nancy Pelosi chiming in here is the cherry on top. What are her motives? She’s supporting Biden but at the same time chastising him with “advice” like “pretend you have a cold when around women.” I’ll have to admit I let out an audible snort through both nostrils. This women has some massive grapefruits when it comes to playing the political game. To somehow lend credence to this entire story can’t really help Joe Biden......can it?

chabanais,Although it was widely reported that IMF loans of $35B helped finance CIA-MOSSAD 'flower revolution' in Ukraine then install an illegal (by their own admission) dual-Israeli Junta in Kiev it was John Kerry-Kohn who embezzled $50B from US taxpayer's General Fund to 'backstop the IMF loans' doubling down on the illegal IMF financing scheme as reported in NYT and WSJ.Of course the IMF immediately cashed out leaving US taxpayers holding a bag of $35B illiquid Junta junk bonds which will never be repaid and Kerry-Kohn also bicycled $15B to WB to fund upgrading Ukraine highways and bridges to battle tank capacity.Your last life savings...never coming back.Where is Kerry-Kohn now?

LupulinWithin,"Bernie is gonna burn down the Democratic party twice and he isn't even a part of it.  This is probably the funniest shit they've ever inflicted on themselves. The runup to 2020 will be quite entertaining. Until someone buys him a car. The Democratic civil war is some A+ entertainment It is for now but it remains to be seen if a la Trump a superlative candidate emerges from the Democrat field with a dynamic and rejuvenating agenda for the American People.I don't see it happening.  Trump's advantage is that shit just does not stick to him.  If you're a Democrat contender you've got to run on a sterling reputation because what you're fronting to the American people is moral authority and ethical perfection.  You would have to navigate the primaries with your credibility intact which will be next to impossible when the other candidates are borderline sociopaths committed to your destruction.Whoever emerges from the Dem primaries may be too wounded to compete. I agree. I thought Biden had a chance against Trump IF he ran as a reasonable moderate. However a moderate won't make it through the primaries Joe knows that so he veered far left. Since all the Dem candidates are racing each other to the left and they can't dispute the policies their rivals espouse (since that is what they're running on as well) they have to destroy the person. Since different candidates are getting varying amounts of support from varying media company panies it stands to reason that over the years these companies have quite a bit of dirt on every candidate. The republicans in 2016 were really entertaining as well. I didn't really like any of them Trump included(I've come around since then and he's got my vote in 2020)I loved one debate where Rubio kept trying to go into this bizarre script like he booted it up word for word multiple times ""first of all we need to dispel the fiction that barack obama doesnt know what he's doing. He knows EXACTLY what he's doing."" Regardless of the context of why he was given the opportunity to speak he launched into this little speech. It was bizarre. And the republicans were all so cutthroat chris christie called him out on it and was savage about it. no punches pulled I believe he called him a robot.When you have no dog in a fight the fight can be especially entertaining because its all friendly fire. They are gonna tear eachother down relentlessly and all they are really doing is tearing the DNC down. The dems in 2020 are going to be a shitshow.

BrickHardcheese,A few years back I was fucked up on painkillers after a pretty bad surgery and actually started writing a parody novel of the 2016 election and the events that followed it set 300 years after the election narrated by Jeb.It was actually avocados that ended up sparking the first Great War. After the president put massive tariffs on Mexico the price of avocados skyrocketed and with them so did the price of avocado toast. That ended up being the final straw that caused the Millennials to revolt. They recreated Calexit in order to secede from the Union to erase the tariffs and restore the availability of avocado toast.That sparked a second civil war and from there things got out of hand.Also Sean Hannity piloted a giant mech- the Hannitron 1488- that had a shoulder mounted cannon that shot fully loaded AR-15s.Anyway oxys are pretty strong. Was a weird week. But I actually like avocado toast for breakfast! First this trade-off is totally worth it. Second the Mexican avocado farms were extortioned/taken over by the cartels over the past five years so double win. Third millennial tears so triple win. Fourth I live in what used to be the avocado capital of the world until the cheap labor of Mexico killed the local farm economy so this is good news for us. I see a quadruple win developing. I eat avocados EVERY DAY sometimes multiple times a day and feel like if this helps stop the illegals bring it on. I’ll find something else to love.From a conservative millennial Fuck avocados. Stop the illegals. I approve this message. Why would would we have less groceries if we used taxes to help our citizens? Because the people who allocate resources in a centrally planned economy have no way of knowing the best way to allocate those resources but citizens on a price coordinated market do. Do the citizens know how to allocate resources either though? Hunger homelessness and health care are huge issues in this country but it seems like the wealthy citizens are concerned with making themselves wealthier not bringing everyone up with them. There's less poverty than at any other point in human history.Wealthy people can only (legally) make themselves wealthier by providing goods and services for other people. (This wouldn't be true under socialism)Every citizen can make the decision that they believe are best and when they inevitably make mistakes it mostly means they lose money rather than the entire country's economy falling apart.

Nguyễn Văn Thiệu had zero intention of meeting with the NLF. Johnson could call it ""treason"" but that doesn't make it so any more than the breathless college socialists of today screaming it about Trump. Especially when the meetings happened two months later anyway on terms pretty unfavorable to a US victory since Johnson had stopped the bombings to help Humphrey's election chances. It’s definitely not just a flaw like any other president had. Imagine if Obama had secretly told Kim Jong-Un to cancel him meetings with Trump.And I don’t need to prove the talks would’ve brought peace he interfered with our government and ruined even having a chance! Of course the terms were unfavorable we were losing and in the end we lost.

guanaco55,"Biden is the Dems best chance of beating Trump in 2020. By sabotaging him they are sabotaging themselves. Guess that's what happens to an old white guy in 2019. Tbh he was the one I had the most concern over IF he ran as a moderate. Thankfully he did not so his rivals had to knock him out. Tell me 1 of the professed candidates that is so far squeaky clean. I think he'd give Trump a run for his money but he's too moderate too white too old and too male to be their nominee. He's no moderate. Just look at his 'white guilt' virtue signalling about Anita Hill recently. He's posturing to appeal to the far left radicals who are trying to hijack that party. Exactly. But since he went there I have to assume that he is being ""sincere"". I don't think he was being sincere. Total pander. All the more reason to grind him into *#metoo dust. Somehow Biden's behavior wasn't a problem when he was Obama's VP but it's a problem now? Someone in the DNC doesn't want him as their nominee and they're trying to sink his campaign before it starts. It's obvious. It’s one thing when he touches a woman it’s a whole other thing when he molests young girls right on camera.  Just do a search and see all the girls he groped while taking group pictures with other politicians well if killing his mistress and being a traitorous drunk didn't disqualify Teddy boy I don't see this as a disqualifier but it does dim his chances of getting the nomination.

SuperCharged2000,We just want common sense border control and Common Sense abortion control. Just common sense lawsnobody's trying to take your vaginaI don't see why you can't just come to the table and compromise? I live in a country with very strict gun laws. Getting a legal firearm is possible but it's ridicuously complex and lengthy. SOme highlights: Extensive background check (on par with the background check required for confidential defense work). Minimum 1 year member in good standing of a licenced shooting club. Minimum number (I think 12) of official shooting practice sessions registered.Then maybe you can go buy a very overpriced firearm (which are extremely limited in choice). Then go to local police to get gun licence. Bring gun licence to seller. Get gun.Then register gun at local police. Local police will show up at random on your doorstep to check your storage facilities.Don't let them in? Felony. I used to hav a gun licence and several firearms. I sold them all and gave it up because of all the bullshit the goverment started to impose. Regulations are getting stricter by the year and gun violence is at an all time high.Gun crime is still very much a thing. Terrorist attacks with guns are still very much a thing.

across16,"This remains one of my favorite gifs about Venezuela A classic That’s a good version of that jif. A whosey doozy? Did you say JJiiiiiiif? iTs nOt rEaL SoCiAlIsM! I still remember the first time I heard that.  I was in high school during the Cold War and some dimwit was touting socialism as being superior to capitalism.  I pointed out the failures of socialist countries like the Soviet Union and China and was told that those weren't ""real.""  First of all if only the most pure dictionary-definition-compliant system is worthy of scrutiny then it's equally fair to say that capitalism has never been fairly tried either.  However my reply at the time was something along the lines of ""Socialism has had (at the time) more than five decades to work and controls over a quarter of the world's population.  How much more time and resources do they need to make it work?"" All of them. The answer is all of them. I wouldn’t say it’s that black and white. We have plenty of socialist policies. It’s more of a spectrum. A socialist system where everyone makes the same amount of money will fail every time but there are a lot of successful countries with many socialist practices. There are some nutty people who think pure socialism is good but from what I understand that isn’t common even among libs. Isn't China the second largest economy in the world and grown at a good rate for 20 years? It is now and even then there's some hinky accounting going on.  But that growth only began after they threw off much of what made them communist at the time I was leveling my criticism.  (Mao was still in charge at the time.)  Their current progress also came at the cost of tens of millions of lives so there's that working against the ""success"" of their system too.[Edit:  LOL @ down-voting a criticism of genocide in China.  Stay classy Reddit.] So not real Socialism or Communism? No... they tried real socialism/communism and found it lacking.  That's just it:  no matter who was in charge or how many ""counterrevolutionaries"" they slaughtered or how many of their neighbors they invaded to strip-mine for resources or how many decades they had to fine-tune the system while wielding absolute power the Utopian ideal always turns into blood and poverty sooner or later.  To the extent that China has had more recent success it is directly linked to the degree to which they've backed off from the worst aspects of the Utopian theory.  Even the most hard-core socialists eventually realize that socialism doesn't work.No society is entirely one way or the other and ""socialist"" countries can be fairly successful under certain temporary conditions (like the racial and political homogeneity that mostly exists in the Nordic countries for the time being supplemented by the fact that the U.S. has secured their borders since 1945).  But even then they are not as rich as they could be so they're paying a hidden price even now.  To them the ""social safety net"" is worth it but it's likely that they have no idea of the opportunity cost they're paying.  I doubt there's even a way to calculate it.  Anyway even they are headed for a reckoning as they import a hostile population that contributes little will not assimilate and breeds like flies.  At some point there will be real economic suffering and quite possibly blood.[Edit:  the down-vote button is not the ""I disagree"" button.] I pointed out the failures of socialist countries like the Soviet Union and China and was told that those weren't ""real.""But when someone points out the success of China you say that arent ""Real"". I am just pointing out the same thing.But like you say""No society is entirely one way or the other and ""socialist"" countries can be fairly successful""I agree with Capitalism is far superior. I just hate the "" Ts nOt rEaL SoCiAlIsM! "" meme when it is only used for failing countries. Perhaps I'm not being clear.  Mao ruled China with an iron fist and had 100% authority to implement real socialism.  Stalin was in the same power situation in the Soviet Union.  Both of them were devoted to imposing real socialism/communism and everything they did and everyone they killed was in service to bringing about communist Utopias.Both systems were abject failures.  The USSR came off the rails in a big dramatic way while China took a different route and dialed back the crazy in a controlled manner.  Neither country has ""real"" socialism now but they certainly tried to implement the Utopian ideals for a long time with no serious internal impediments.  Even with decades to make it work and absolute power to murder anyone who stood in the way and almost unlimited resources and no real external threats (except for a few years of fighting against Imperial Japan and a rival socialist system from Germany) socialism in both the USSR and China failed to deliver Utopia (and often even bread)... and failed in spectacular fashion.Failing is what socialism does.  The more ""real/pure"" it is the worse it gets in practice.  In mixed economies the socialist portions act as parasites on the capitalist portions and that can go on for a long time but any success is in spite of the socialist aspects not because of them.  Some countries like the socialist aspects because they want more of an official social safety net than capitalism may provide (capitalism tends to do a much better job at creating informal social safety nets though) but they do so at an economic cost. That's their choice but it's neither free nor efficient despite the brickbats they throw at more capitalist systems.

In Europe many people are being silenced.I recall a few years ago a Swedish politician was fined for criticizing Islam even though he was literally just citing statistics about Muslim crime and terrorism. And this was an actual member of government. Just imagine what an ordinary citizen would face.In the UK people are geting arrested for tweeting the wrong gender pronouns at people. Literally.In some European countries being ""hateful"" is actually illegal but only when that hate is directed at non-conservative demographics. The hate speech laws are never used to protect conservative demographics such as Christian white males. Check out the amount of college campus events by conservative speakers that get shut down by threats or staff. Ben Shapiro comes to mind. A campus org at my uni hired security “just in case” for a regular meeting with some lesser known speakers. I can't find evidence of any of your claims. Conservative governments are prolific in Europe.I likewise cannot find any evidence of your claims. Trump  check. Bad Check. Trump check. Good Check.Congrats on proving my point. I didn't say he was good. The European Court of Human Rights ruled that calling Muhammad a pedophile a factual statement is not protected speech. In the UK a mother was arrested for misgendering someone in a tweet. These are just the two big ones that I remember. You probably don't like the sources but left wing news simply doesn't report these things. Also are you just going to skip over CNN MSNBC and others fear mongering over Russia for two years as not being a threat to critical thinking? https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/arrests-for-offensive-facebook-and-twitter-posts-soar-in-london-a7064246.htmlIs this good enough for you?It's a bit old but still applies. The numbers are probably higher today. The legend red Forman This is the same exact meme that the LEFT are using...  I guess it works both ways???  Who are you?  Who is making you say this?  If you talk to the proper authorities they should be able to protect you and your loved ones...  God bless! Or my favorite by a modernist: We can't tolerate the intolerant hence censoring you is justified. They should be receiving a taste of their own medicine. Sweet sweet justice. Let’s go and start accusing all the dems of rape whenever they want to get an important position! Never give power to government that you wouldn’t give to Hitler.Never empower government to disempower you. Liberals know that if conservatives ever get the power to silence them the conservatives will stick to their principals and not do it.  So they can silence you all they want without fear of reprisal. It's a safe gambit though as classically liberal minded folks rarely abuse such powers.Look at reddit.  Conservative/right subs will reluctantly seek to ban abuses to maintain an open fora but after awhile will usually revert back to a laissez-faire model.  Contrast that with progressive/left subs where occasionally controlling the narrative is the only alternative success they have in their lives.Their inability to be persuasive is a tremendous source of anxiety. They ban wrongthink with great zeal in the quest to bring about righteous transformation of society usually one in which it is historically inevitable that they will be found to be universally credible.  In the final solution all users exist to serve the cause and any incidental casualties from overzealousness are subordinate to a means which is also an ends. I thought boomer memes were passive agressive qoutes usually about first world problems next to a picture of a yellow minion. No those are Karen memes. Speaking of Karen could you please let me see the kids? You have literally never submitted anything to this sub yet you are whining about the content.That's /r/ChoosingBeggars material right there. People who complain about ""boomers"" only know how to whine. A decade ago boomer referred to people who made babies in the 80s and enjoyed the economy of the time. Is the term different now? It's shorthand for ""baby boomer"" which relates to having a lot of children in a good economy. It relates to lame obvious crap that people make that makes us as a group look unappealing. It’s like controlled opposition at this point. So boomer just means ""lame things my parents like""? Just trying to get a gauge on what the term refers to. ""Us as a group"" is a large variety of people.It's just kind of funny if the term no longer has anything to do with its origin which was how baby boomers made tons of kids and retired. ""Boomer"" just means 'old out of touch people'.  And since the only people who go 'lol old people' are kids 25 and younger that means ""Boomer"" applies to anybody they see as old and out of touch.  So if you're 35 and don't use whatever gay app the kids send dick pics with this week you're a boomer. Are you a boomer? Not by the definition I grew up on. That's why I keep asking you to elaborate on what it means. If ""boomer"" now means 'lame of older than ten years ago' that may apply. It’s not a matter of its literal definition it’s an association. It’s a way of thinking. It’s the generation that brought down this country with all its simple minded hippie bullshit. That type of simple minded naive thinking is what people call boomer shit.",0,False,t3_b85giq,41,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b85giq/for_the_dumbasses_trying_to_censor_conservative/,544,,For the dumbasses trying to censor conservative speech,544,https://i.redd.it/op81fhd3cbiz.jpg
Clatsop,"Butthurt Brigaders So we should legalize drugs? Yeah. Among consenting adults.Inb4 ""but what if they do XXXX while high""The answer is XXXX is already illegal arrest em for that. I feel like this argument always goes down the road of all or nothing. Nobody seems to take into account the gradient of harmfulness amongst all the popular drugs. Obviously heroin/pcp/meth should not be stuff you can buy at your local 7-11 but there's not much wrong with weed aside from some degenerates smoking it all day and doing nothing. I think a fine line can be drawn at weed/psilocybin/lsd/dmt and maybe mdma. Perhaps only allow licensed people to administer psychedelics and make a business out of it. Regardless I still think drug offenders should be separated from violent offenders and there should be more emphasis on rehabilitating drug criminals as opposed to tossing them in with violent gangs who force them into their lifestyle at knifepoint. I didn't forget about drugs like heroin. I genuinely believe that assistance to addicts who want assistance would be cheaper and more effective at lowering usage rates than criminalization.Portugal is the only first world country I can think of with true decriminalization of that type of drug and they've seen usage rates go down in the 10 years since policy change.I may be wrong but just like you I want to help users/potential users. I'm not being heartless because of some absolute philosophy I can't move. I'm wary of full blown decriminalization at least not without accessible treatment. It doesn't do a whole lot to just set up needle shacks where people can go shoot up and move on but the system does need to be changed to keep drug addicts out of prison where they get unfettered access to more drugs and nothing better to do than take them. The only way to get people off drugs especially heroin is to take them out of the environment that got them hooked get them somewhere that they have no instant access and replace the habit with something healthier. The tricky part with weed is how long it stays in your system. If Joe Schmo crane operator drops a multi-ton I-beam at work and injures/kills someone the drug test isn't really going to be able to tell if he smoked a joint before work or a week ago. So what does the company do then?Maybe a poor example and I don't smoke so I can't speak from experience when someone inevitably replies with the ""derr dats naht how weed werks!"" but regardless there's a lot of liability type things to talk about that most people don't seem to consider when discussing the topic.There's a reason I can't fly an airplane for like five days after taking a single Benadryl I can't imagine how they're going to write regs for marijuana et al. This is a fantastic example of a problem that needs solving. And a solution is needed regardless of legality because even something as mundane as driving while high needs to be illegal (and more illegal than possession). And people can/do smoke before doing that stuff now.I don't however see it as having any bearing on whether it should be legal.Illegality has barred research into the effects of weed. People make crazy claims about it basically being a miracle drug with no side effects and they propagate relatively unchecked because medical studies simply aren't done.I wasn't suggesting no drug laws at all and negligence is negligence and a real test needs to formulated. I don't disagree! With how prevalent it's gotten I don't much care if it's legal or not. I'm pretty libertarian when it comes to what people want to do own their own time or with their own money but not to the point where things should be completely hands off. Drugs absolutely impact society and usually in negative ways. Just because it's legal doesn't mean it should be encouraged. I love the idea of CBD and THC for medicinal purposes but out of prohibition so many liars come up.People claim that cbd will cure this and that that it’s not a drug and other stuff. This is purely wrong and a disservice to those who find it medically beneficial. cbd will cure this and that that it’s not a drugIf you mean “drug” as in the same way aspirin & hydrocortisone cream are drugs then yes.  If you mean “drug” as in mind-altering substance like hallucinogens or narcotics then no.  CBD has no THC (or trace amounts too low to even show up on a piss test).  I know some about this because my elderly ma uses it for arthritis in her back But Joe Schmo can still do drugs that result in the same situation even if they are illegal.Jobs with safety restrictions not allowing drugs is different than the government deciding.  Heck plenty of jobs have alcohol restrictions and alcohol is completely legal. Right but the point is that if it's legal and Joe does it legally and then fucks up on the job it can't really be proven if the marijuana was at fault because it stays in the body for so long. So how do you enforce company policy without proof? There's no breathalyzer for weed and it's not always obvious if someone is mildly high. Alcohol is obvious and metabolizes in a matter of hours not days. If the company fires Mr. Schmo without cause or proof they're in for a hell of a lawsuit. But a company also can't be taking chances on high employees working with dangerous equipment. Jobs still make doing it not allowed. So if you want to want to do it get a job that doesn’t make it not allowed. Construction workers in general might be an example of a job where they do not allow you to smoke because of the liabilities you just said and thus if they find out you do it you get fired. I don't understand why you need to know if he was high. The crime is fucking up at work whether he is high or not... Because in one case it's a freak accident and in the other case it's criminal recklessness/negligence. True I didn't consider that. Making a mistake while high would probably have a more severe punishment than making a mistake while sober.Example from my life: I dropped an appliance while making a delivery and sliced my hand needed stitches. I tested clean so workers comp kicked in and they gave me time off to heal up. If I hadn't passed I likely would have been fired and/or liable for the damage regardless of if I was high at the time of the accident. nope youre 100% correct on this.You can test positive for weed up to 1 month from when you stopped smoking depending on your build (THC stores in fat cells) and frequency of smoking.To the best of my knowledge there is no test that can single out whether youre high right now or quit smoking a month ago.Although strides in that area are being made:https://www.npr.org/2018/08/04/634992695/the-pot-breathalyzer-is-here-maybe Here is a New York attorney explaining common sobriety tests for when alcohol is not involved but an officer suspects drug use:https://youtu.be/sa6c5COMUVkEssentially one of the clearest bodily signs that suggests impairment is dilation of the pupils. If a flashlight is shined into your eyes they do not dilate your eyes don’t converge AND a test shows THC presence in the last month it would certainly be reasonable to conclude that you were high at the time the sobriety test was performed. This still doesn't conclusively prove drug use during the time of operation.There's a reason that further testing beyond field sobriety tests are currently required.  I certainly would not feel comfortable knowing that a police officer his flashlight and his word are the only basis needed to convict me of a fairly serious crime.Fallibility is very real and some officers have a tendency to stretch the truth in order to justify probably cause.An office saying he saw issues with dilation and then a test showing someone had smoked within the last month is a pretty poor standard of proof that an individual was actively operating a vehicle under the influence and one that is potentially rife for abuse. You now have given me a new game to play next time I smoke. Dilation is a beautiful process anyways (irises are gorgeous) but it'll be interesting to see what happens. I had a roommate (was an EMT) who would do this at parties to check for alcohol poisoning. For company policy they could just state you're not allowed to have smoked weed in the last 30 days or whatever for working with equipment like that. I think companies should have pretty broad latitude when it comes to setting their own policies.As for ""under influence"" type laws. Well it's just up to the state to find ways to prove their case. And if they can't prove it because the item in question doesn't allow too bad for them.I mean I could have all sorts of bad things hidden by RSA encryption on my computer that the state can't access. We shouldn't make it illegal because of that.Same with booze in the 1800's. No breath or blood tests back then so if they wanted drunk laws they couldn't just go ""we can't test make it illegal"". They had to figure out how to work with it.",0,False,t3_b80jf1,169,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b80jf1/this_time_it_will_work/,2098,,This time it will work...,2098,https://i.imgur.com/jQhjZj9.jpg

optionhome,"It actually boggles the mind to hear Democrats advocate for unlimited foreign immigration via open borders whilst simultaneously saying we need higher wages. How stupid can they be? Very stupid apparently. If someone seems to hold a contradictory opinion its probably because their stated goals arent their real motivations For a lot of these people immigration is the following:A way to prop up the birth rate.A way to diversify america because white=badA way to seem empathetic You forgot that it’s a way to keep Democrats in power. Yep do the math:Congressional representation includes illegal population.Over 60% of illegals live in 20 (""D"") metro areas. (Added bonus- some illegals do vote)It's not good for the immigrants either. They do get some government entitlements especially if they have children but because of the failure of Congress to address the issue (like temporary work visas etc.) most illegal immigrants live a distinctly un-American life inside this country. Can they get bank loans to start a business? Can they fly to Chicago for a job interview? Can they get a professional or tradesman's license? How many jobs/opportunities are they shut out of? Isn't this permanent second class status?How noble of the Democrats! They also get counted in censuses and give Democrat states more federal power in the way of more House Representatives.Obamacare passed by a very slim vote margin in the House (220-215) that was only possible because illegal immigrants were boosting blue state House representation. Also think of all those illegals working illegally under the table. What is their legal recourse if they get hurt on the job or the boss refuses to pay earned wages? It works out better for the plantation owner when the slaves willingly stay on it no chains necessary. Yeah that’s mostly what it is.  It’s about automatically having millions of new supporters That's the only reason.  Everything else is just window dressing. There are a lot of reasons. This is a very broad coalition and that is why it is so hard to address. Everyone thinks mass immigration is to their advantage even if they know it will destroy the country.For many employers it is s source of cheap labor. This includes hospitality construction small businesses large retail and everything in between. (These business owners are also the political donors and the people our representatives meet at breakfasts and beefsteaks when they go to their home districts. These are the guys running a 50 man construction crew telling them that without immigration they would be out of business since Americans don't work as hard.)For large businesses it is a client base. Walmart knows how much of their growth each year is in Spanish speaking customers and they see no reason to give up that growth just to preserve US civilization.For the administrative class they are also a client base. Many cities and states like NJ have reached the point where the administrators - social workers criminal justice schools etc. - are dependent on this underclass since they need so many more services than the well established citizens. This is more subtle but think of it this way: after seeing the problems in schools with high immigrant enrollment how could organizations like the teacher's union advocate for more immigration unless they cared more about their own career growth opportunities than the education of citizens.For the upper classes they feel insulated enough from the down sides and they understand that people only get wealthy in a growth industry. Growth is the great wealth generator. It is the reason Apple is worth more than GM. When a company grows the people at top are catapulted like on a trebuchet and the easiest way to have growth is to increase the population. Of course this only works if government borrows and subsidizes and that can not go on for ever but by then the upper class will be  secure enough to deal with the risk.For the political class it is new voters and new problems for them to solve. There is a common form of political power which comes in the form of a political ""machine."" The machine exists to control the problems it creates (or at least encourages.) These problems insure that the machine is well funded and the spending to control also forms the power necessary to manage the problem to keep it at the right level of threat to those paying the bills. The machine becomes a form of protection racket - the taxpayers just want the problem managed and the immigrants want the benefits paid to them to be less of a nuisance. If the problem is solved the machine no longer has a justification to exist. If the problem gets too large the taxpayers demand radical change so the problem is always kept at just the right level. Political machines have existed throughout history in different forms.For the mega donors they see themselves as world citizens and they actively want to destroy the country. They see ""globalism"" (""internationalism"") as a way to solidify their position among the super-elite. They support anything that destroys free markets since the opposite of free is controlled and they are the controllers. They support these foundations spreading propaganda and organizing protests since what is bad for the US is good for them by their zero-sum logic. And surely a lot of this activity is funded by groups and countries that are true enemies of the US and Western Civilization. They know what they are doing.The birth rate argument is weak and it is used as an excuse but I do not think any serious economist actually believes millions of dependent citizens will benefit the country in any way.The arguments for ""diversity"" and to seem empathetic are very real and mostly adhered to by the ""useful idiots"" who are not driving the movement but who are the major component of advocates.I have probably  left out some groups. but this is a start. A way to prop up the birth rate.A way to diversify america because white=bad🤔🤔🤔Really makes ya think I've heard both of these opinions from Democrats no joke. It's very weird. Why is it weird?If they wanted to increase birthrates they could do what china poland hungary and russia are doing.They dont want higher birthrates for a certain group and actively import people to make it harder for them to have kids and support themI wonder what the UN would call purposefully imposing conditions to reduce a populations ability to reproduce🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 I wonder if we’ll find the courage to fight back in a meaningful way before it’s too late.

skarface6,This doesn’t work depending on where you are I will forever be annoyed with the Republican Democrat color switch The year 2000 was when they realized that they were too socialist to be red. When you are too socialist that red is not socialist enough. Something like that. Karl Marx was extremely well educated and he was a philosopher telling people that he had no brain is extremely ignorant. The socialist and communist dictators misused his work to become powerful.Should’ve put someone like Stalin mao Lenin or any other blood thirsty communists. This is saying “you” as in modern living people. Plus educated people do dumb things all the time and make it look like they have no brain. It’s pretty damn stupid saying that Karl Marx is the reason behind the huge deaths in the east he was simply a critic of capitalism which is not perfect.Marx even said that communism will never work in a country like Russia or China due to the fact that they weren’t industrialized. Uh...where did I say any of those things? With your better dead than red meme? ...it said that he’s the reason behind Mao killing millions?And it’s hilarious that he’s “just a critic of capitalism”.

Yosoff,Aren't soldiers allowed to drink on a base regardless of age?Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but that's what I've heard. It depends on the base there are only a few that allow it.  For example Camp Pendleton only allows it because it is so close to Tijuana and they don't want Marines heading down there every weekend. I was on Camp Pendleton for 4 years (age 18-22) and you can’t drink under age. You can lose rank if found drinking under age. Well back in my day...I wonder when it changed. You know how it goes. Some underage Marines start drinking in the barracks next thing you know there's a few dead hookers and a couple barracks rooms are on fire. Suddenly no more underage drinking and a new item for the safety brief. That's why we can't have nice things.. No that's why one bad apple spoils the bunch is the most backwards and asinine approach to punishment. One of the dumbest rules I've seen is only being allowed to store so much alcohol in the barracks normally something like one bottle of liquor or case of beer. The obvious solution is to drink all the extra alcohol they bought. Makes sense.And just so I'm clear I agree with the comic's general point. If you join the service you should be granted special permission to drink regardless of age. Or just lower the drinking age to 18 and simplify things. Drinking age should be 16 driving age should be 21... Voting age 30 I mean lacking driving privileges removes a lot of autonomy especially if you live far from a city. Without a driving licence I wouldn't have been able to get a job until 19 when I moved to the city. What year was this? Not every base. Alot of AETC bases like Keesler AFB are very strict on it. In the US I don't know of any. However the bases will generally adhere to host country's laws on alcohol use. For example I was able to legally drink in Japan at the age of 20 while I was there. Got it out of my system by the time I was 21 and didn't see what all the rage was about when I got back to the States. In the USA: Some. In Canada: Only if you like confinemant to barracks w/t extra work and drill. In the Marine Corps it was based on the law of the country you were in. In the US no underage drinking. If say you were on deployment and stop in Thialand drink away. Maybe if you're overseas but i'm pretty sure thats not the case anywhere in the U.S. At least not in my experience. Excuse me but this isn't what I ordered.  I ordered the funnies special with a side of satire.  Instead I got a double portion of feels.  I'd like a refund. If you're old enough to give your life for your country then you're old enough to have a damned brewsky. You realize how many underage soldiers I got beer for in the barracks. I rarely drink and everyone knew that but when the barracks inspections came I had more liquor in my fridge/shelves than anyone. The leadership all knew I was holding down the liquor for the guys.They never pressed much about it.As the first SGM I had said you’re old enough to die for this country then you are old enough to drink just don’t do it off the compound. If the Democrats made voting at 16 their platform and the Republicans made drinking at 18 theirs Republicans would get all the young votes. You can already vote at 18 ya dingus.

deathomas,"Yes global warming is in fact happening. But the key take away is there are several factors for this happening and it is not all the human races fault. A lot of it happens to do with us being in an a holoscene. It's a layer of creamy facts under a massive amount of spun garbage. There's been too much fact manipulation to consider what's left believable. Al Gore certainly didn't help making a movie that turned out to be complete bogus. So is it real or not and what facts do you have to support your claim It's neither since we can't prove it either way. Yes climate change is real. However the issue many people have is what is the natural progression of climate for a planet like Earth and whether or not humans have catastrophically impacted it. I'm worried humans doing too much to try and ""reverse"" what libs believe the problem to be could have way worse effects. Planets evolve.  It's a thing.  Been going on here on Earth for......4-5 billion years?  With or without us it will continue for a few billion more years.  The question is really ""How much is planet-based evolution vs. Human caused?""Look at it this way; 120 years ago nobody knew what an airport was or the internet or Facebook but some folks want to tell us that they can predict what will be going on 120 years from now......lol.Seriously as far as timelines go Humans haven't even really existed yet.  Earth has been around for 4-5 billion years Humans have been around for 200000 years (Homo sapiens idaltu) or 0.004% of Earth's existence.  Just how arrogant are we humans to think that with as little time as we have been on Earth that we have it all figured out? “We’re a surface nuisance.” - George Carlin “We’re a surface nuisance.” - George CarlinMan I miss that guy ='( Climate changes.  That's a fact.   Everything else attached to the conversation though is just speculation and for the most part speculation by people who shouldn't be speculating in the first place.What bothers me most about the conversation is that it has been going on since at least the 70s without proof.   We mock doomsayers when they talk about how aliens are going to invade or Jesus is predicated to come on a certain date.   Yet how many times have people promoting climate change stood there and predicated dates only to be wrong over and over?I'm not denying climate change.  I'm simply  saying that I don't think we have truly valid proof at this point.  Not when they say things like how the Great Lakes are shrinking but instead were nearing record highs.But I'm not a scientist.   More importantly I'm not one which specializes in climate.   Maybe Bill Nye can answer the question though.   He is after all a engineer... Yes but do you trust our retarded government to fix it. Liberals hate trump but are gung ho on giving them all our money and guns and freedom! The climate changes but I ain’t buying the leftist attempt to redistribute wealth to achieve a solution.

TheGlen,"People have attacked my Christianity because I dont support socialism. Its hilarious. That’s hard dude. It really ticks me off when people tell me it’s “unchristian” to not support a welfare state. Yeshua didn’t need the a govt. to help the poor he just did it. No I just believe in Jesus there's no ""Conservative"" or ""Liberal"" version of him. It just happens that Biblical principles inform my Conservative ones. And all my relatives are Christian so... Lol that video is pretty terrible but at least it's well produced.And I have no idea what you mean by the Sodom story and the demon-possessed man. You keep doing you fam. Uh? No it's not from Sodom it's from Leviticus. God lists the forbidden sexual acts which can be summed up as ""no close relatives no animals and no gays."" Ooh.  Using the well worn Progressives are smarter approach.  Bold move Cotton.  Let us know how the collusion thing works out. ""Our"" money?More like: ""But Jesus I do help the poor! I painlessly voted to have the government take money from those people over there who I envy. I also pay a token amount."" This IS a great post. How is it that I've never seen this one before!? Sure the widow giving her last two dollars might be making a greater sacrifice than the rich guy giving from his excess but where it's really at is stealing from the rich guy so you can donate more of his money.  The whole ""thou shalt not steal"" thing doesn't apply when you intend to do something good with the money. Everybody knows that intentions are far more important than actual results And what of yourself that you are willing to sacrifice doesn't matter at all.  It's all about signalling virtue rather than actual virtue. Bro. Nobody wants your plumber money.We want to support the homeless people on our corners to GTFO our street corners and be supported but that may come at the expense of Devoss money. Or gasp ......Koch money I love it! Socialism is the product of the juxtaposition of atheists wanting a system that reduces suffering and poverty.  Make meming great again! Poor and helpless not people who are poor and worthless but capable. We aren’t asking our politicians to do it for us. We live it out in the real world because it is the right thing to do. Jesus didn’t command us to force others to give. He told us to do it so we do it. It’s not the governments job to fix every problem. Passing a tax cut for us.

Lepew1,Coronary artery disease doesn’t care about your feelings Neither does diabetes. Now that is hilarious! How is this funny? I'm not offended in just genuinely confused as to the punchline to the joke. On the one hand you have claims that genetics drives the condition and the user is a prisoner to genetics with no option out. Thus what you were genetically given makes you a victim and you can not be shamed over that because you have no ability to change things.On the other hand you have a biological sex which is genetically driven interpreted as a social construct and influenced by environment and choice. You pick where you want to go and you are not a prisoner of genetics.The two ideas are logically inconsistent.So the way to explain that is to apply post modernism to logic itself and infer that logic itself is subjective. Going meta in this manner is surprising and some find it funny. If one denies the objective value of logic one is free to embrace illogical inconsistency and the world becomes an even crazier mess. They're not really logically inconsistent because they're two separate things... While fat shaming is undeniably an asshole behavior any critique of fat or obese people is often met with an excuse that it’s genetic glandular something beyond a lack of self control and commitment to exercise. So the punchline is just... That's a thing that people say? That's moronic. Meaning the left will fly off the handle about being told gender is biological but also believe it’s possible for you to be genetically predisposed to be fat.

If their opinions are so feeble they need to hide behind ridiculous accusations of racism what does that say about their opinions?They don’t know why they believe what they believe just what their media handlers tell them to believe.

Yosoff,Lenience in law enforcement is also the main reason that San Francisco and Seattle are literal shitholes.  Proportionality is a primary component of justice that can be failed in either direction. watch drugs inc and u'll see why Target the industry not the user Typically consumption is a rider charge. As in the asshole was being arrested for other things. Selling drugs though is a stand alone offense. Can I get a tldr? Point still remains. The alcohol prohibition worked just as bad. Idiolgical statements like that ignore reailty if you want to legalise weed then say that if you want a refomation of the justice systme say that but don't try and make it so grandiose Okay then. I want to legalize all drugs. But prohibition did decrease the amount of drinking and drunkenness. I believe spouse abuse also dropped and there were many good benefits. That might be true but it also created the mafia and it destroyed peoples lives. If you believe in fiscal responsibility to the individual then you must believe in social responsibility too. The mafia existed long before prohibition.I do believe in responsibility and I believe that the mafia thrived exactly where corruption allowed it to whether or not prohibition was in place. For the vast majority of America people drank a lot less beat their wives a lot less and we were happier for it. Nobody is forcing you to drink now. Take responsibility for your own lives and others can take care of theirs. You have no right to violently atop people from peacefully living their lives. I have every right to stop people from violating other people's rights. Yes but smoking weed doesn't violate anyones right neither does smoking weed nor drinking. Idk guy that’s a pretty strange standard to set. Should you be free to hurt yourself? What if someone’s deranged and needs to be committed and there’s no one close to them who’ll help them? The government isn't your babysitter Wow thanks for that. As someone who subscribes to the conservative subreddit that’s definitely something I needed to be told Alcohol is orders of magnitude moee dangerous and unhealthy for you it cause domestic violence drunk driving and a host of medical issues.  And it is legal. That’s a good point. People should really understand that they should never try highly addictive substances. They are extremely hard to stop using and usually your life will be destroyed one way or another. In my opinion government should be providing free drugs to users while always trying to stop them from using them. This will put an end to the awful illegal drug trade. Without it young people will have less chance of getting addicted to it. So in the long term it should be beneficial. This is why I'm against someone having a record. How can someone get their stuff together if society is constantly holding what you did against you? Perpetual punishment is not justice it's revenge. Your consequences have actions.If you’re wanting to work for me and handle my money I have a right to know if you were locked up for felony theft.You don’t get to hide from your past actions. Your consequences have actions.That's why people are sentenced to some sort of punishment when they are convicted of a crime. Once that punishment has been fulfilled the debt to society has been paid. Bringing up a past transgression after the law has been satisfied is as vengeful and wrong as a spouse who brings up the past even after they say they have forgiven you.I have a right to know if you were locked up for felony theft.Why? Because once a thief always a thief?

Today I noticed that the comments section on the YouTube videos was gone. I could see the views and thumbs up or down but no comments. My first thought was that I was being punished further by YouTube turning off the comments sections so I could not participate by even reading the comments let alone respond – I have been “suspended” from participating in YouTube features because I broke a rule(s). But this story is not about that. Maybe my having Dissenter installed has something to do with the comments being hidden. 

My next thought was maybe I changed the format somehow so I took a look around in the settings. I clicked on those three dots up in the right-hand corner of my Chrome browser and noted something that I had not seen before: there is a little icon and the words at the bottom of the scroll-down: “[**Managed by your organization**](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1331549?p=is_chrome_managed&amp;visit_id=636898228063640577-1051503394&amp;rd=1).” Emphasis added.

That takes us to this help page: “See if your Chromebook or Chrome browser is managed”? 

What is this? 

Why does Google need to know who my computer is associated with? 

Why is it their business? 

Does anyone else have the “Managed by your organization” on their Chrome browser?

I will freely admit that I am not the brightest bulb when it comes to the internet and the workings of things but this bothers me.

Evidently not as it is now the 2nd. https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b8kvmb/april_fools Thank goodness. It has almost always been this way. Maybe 20% more today. Do you have a  smart phone? Lock it and look at the lock screen for a second. That should explain it April 1st happened. Memes are now the future. Why did the default forum conservatives get assigned to memes? Should not a new forum called r/ConservativeMemes be created instead? r/woosh how about r/April1Conservatives ? We did a statistical analysis of our users and their comments using iIBMs Watson and some custom machine learning algorithms.Switching r/conservative to memes only was literally the only logical choice.Please remember to treat this sub like America.

Private property is nothing but a (ominous music)tradition that was programmed into you by the phallogocentric hetero-patriarchy of racist sexist xenophobic wrongthinkers.  So why don't you quit being greedy with the things you bought and we can come together as a community and we will all decide on the best use for those things.  The only thing socialism needs to work is the complete submission of every citizen.  Starting with you. Oh wow I hope this was sarcasm.. Your lack of certainty means it was good. The veil had just the right thinness. I'm still not sure you aren't a troll but you get my upvotes. For now. It's troll day.  In all honesty I am a reactionary. Yes that's factually correct. Your point? I don't think taxing everyone to 90% is morally correct. I think it's morally correct to let people keep more of the money they work hard for. Have a good day xir. Regardless of who is  morally correct do you think a government bureaucracy located thousands of miles away controlling every facet of your life is a good thing? A government deciding what you need how much when and how much you pay is never never a good thing. How would you like a 51% majority of Conservatives controlling your life. So you libs better be careful what you fight for because it could sting for you badly in the end. A company goes out of business quickly if they don’t give a consumer what they want. The government doesn’t care what you want and you cant vote a bureaucrat making those decisions out of an unelected office. but I'd rather have the government controlling things that I absolutely need vs a corporation.IOW you want to be a peasant or subject. Government control of necessities makes you beholden to that government and that's the opposite of how it's supposed to work.Governments should be beholden to you not you beholden to them. This is false. Most people received a tax cut Lol I got a bonus and my job isn’t even the kind that does. It wasn’t huge but it was groceries for the next couple weeks You’re right we should be more like the morally sound left. Convicting people without the need of evidence.

Did you throw a tantrum at work after not getting your way? oh em gee burn Yeah but she’s pretty!!! Fake news She’s pretty cute in this pic but every time she smiles I get crazy stalker girlfriend vibes. Psycho eyes. I mean when she talks it totally ruins it but if you didn’t know who she was and what kind of batshit policies she is pushing wouldn’t you find her attractive? She's definitely a 1. Anyone who says they wouldn't fuck her is an idiot. They can make all the jokes about our cousins they want but I draw the line when they say we’re attracted to horses. Let's get real here. You're only saying she looks like a horse due to the unflattering cherry picked images that conservative outlets use for her photos. If she was a normal everyday girl on the street you'd probably find her attractive. There's nothing wrong with thinking she's good looking. She might be a moron but that doesn't mean you shouldnt fuck her. I'd encourage as many of my conservative brothers to infiltrate her liberal ranks as possible. She really isn’t that pretty. Now you could say I’m biased or whatever since I along with countless others can see that she’s a dumbass but I really don’t find her all that attractive. I really don’t find her all that attractive.That's fine and people have different tastes. I guess I was a fool to say ""Anyone who says they wouldn't fuck her is an idiot."" But I still think she's a 1 on the binary scale when considering looks alone. Her intelligence and politics detract from that greatly. That is ultimately what I was trying to point out and should have been more direct. Glad we can agree. Personally no. No. She’s a DC 9 but a rest-of-country 6.5. Isn't this most Congressmen?

PlymouthSock,"Northern VA represent! Yeah because an armed robbery that threatens life is the same as pecking away at a keyboard to do some super-expensive shady shit. The sentences reflect the seriousness of the crimes and more importantly the threat to human life not the dollar amounts. The last thing the justice system needs to do is place a greater importance upon dollar amounts than human life.Besides the homeless guy now has a roof and three squares while the wealthy shitbird has a far worse living situation and far shittier food than he has ever known. Of the two I’m betting that being in gen pop is significantly more punitive for the pansy-ass wealthy guy than it is for the homeless guy. Firstly it doesn't say he was armed and taking a second to do some research it appears he wasn't. He just claimed to be. Secondly apparently he was handed three stacks of bills and took only a single $100 dollar bill citing hunger as his reason. The minimum sentence for first degree robbery is 3 years. The maximum sentence for a misdemeanor theft (less than $1000) was 6 months. He got 15 years without possibility of parole.The bullshit is real with this story. The differences unfortunately and ironically were money and honesty. The homeless guy plead guilty while ""Wealthy shitbird"" had money and chose to testify and defend himself. While he was not solely responsible his actions contributed to not only the theft of money but the closing of two banks and the loss of employment for those who worked there who were not responsible not to mention any other issues that came from their closing. Not only that but the corrections system is expensive both officially and unofficially. The homeless man is going to suffer for lack of money where the wealthy guy will probably not struggle too much.I don't mean to lecture but this kind of thing pisses me off. Again the threat to life was apparent with the robbery regardless of the threat manifesting as actual or not. That doesn’t matter to the victims and bystanders at the time. If the homeless guy had previous convictions for violent crimes or was on parole for other offenses then punishment for the offense was enhanced or his parole for previous offenses could have been violated adding to his total time behind bars. Judges can’t just make up sentences that go beyond what is legislated. You’re also comparing the minimum and maximum sentences for two entirely different offenses to make a point. One involves threat of harm and the other doesn’t. Let’s stick with apples-to-apples not bananas-to-bulldozers.Now I’m not siding with wealthy guy or saying he’s not deserving of a harsher sentence by any means I’m just looking at it objectively whereas you’ve admitted to not doing so. I understand what you're saying and you're right that I'm not completely objective but having feelings about something doesn't render my thoughts invalid. We aren't machines.My intent with providing the separate min/max sentences was to provide context not compare. Idealism aside I don't believe the punishment fit the crime. How many died because of the financial crisis brought about by greedy immoral scummy bankers? How many people took their own lives after losing their houses and everything they owned? A lot of financial fraud destroys lives a lot more than some guy robbing a bank. I'm actually curious how the Caddo District Court allowed the prosecution to go forward.

chabanais,No one with that point of view has ever see a wrench irl. Are you kidding?! No real eco friendly person or otherwise should use HYDROCARBONS such as natural GAS in their homes! They should use clean electricity! Clean renewable overpriced government subsidized renewable clean electricity. DUH!I only buy free range gluten free vegan electricity for my family. Fully recyclable green and family friendly! Fracking is just giving the earth an enema change my mind. I'm pretty sure natural gas beats electrical heating in terms of energy efficiency unless you have a heat pump. But that's none of my business. Im pretty sure natural gas beats electrical heating in terms of KILLING THE PLANET unless you missed the sarcasm. But that's none of my business. 😉 The planet cannot die. The planet is not alive in a manner like we are. Lifeforms live on the planet. They are the ones that will die just like they've always been doing and nothing is wrong with that as death is part of life. Wait so you're telling me the planet isn't alive?! That means it's already dead! But... but I was told we had 12 more years! Aww CRAP! Can't be already dead. It was never alive. Natural gas beats a heat pump.  Once the temperature drops the heat pump freezes up. Then it goes through a defrost.  It does this when you need the heat the most.  When it's really cold.  When it goes through a defrost it reverses the flow of refrigerant.  This essentially is the the AC.  Yes it turns the AC on when its cold out.  But don't worry it turns the electric heat strips on at the same time the AC is on.  At least until it finally thaws the frozen outdoor coil.  But don't worry because it will do this over and over all day and all night long while it's cold outside.The term heat pump is nothing more than a marketing scheme.  It works fine in warm climates.  Like south Florida!  Anywhere else it's just a big fat waste of money.  Even worse. Now you have more shit to break.  And you overpaid for it up front.But that's none of my business. You can be conservative and still against pipelines.Not even getting into the fact that a lot of proposed pipelines are on track to go through beautiful public fishing and hunting lands but I also just don’t generally like the idea of the government using eminent domain for the benefit of private companies which is what I’ve seen proposed in my home state of Virginia 🙌 NPC: The climate is changing so we should tax the rich to pay for government programs to stop it!Cons: If the world is actually going to end why don’t you make an effort to stop it by not using gas or electricity?NPC: angry face The protestors generally have no clue how their domiciles are heated cooled electrified.....nor where that power source originated or was created. I prefer 18 wheelers being driven by guys on speed to deliver my oil on commuter freeways thanks LOL! We need electric cars because our transportation shouldn't be powered by digging into the ground. Instead we are going to dig into the ground to move the rare polluting metals needed to make the batteries which may end up being powered by gas/coal power plants because God forbid we use nuclear which is safe clean and reliable provided it's managed properly Unless you're in favour of transportjng fuel through another means.,0,False,t3_b82xv7,21,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b82xv7/are_you_against_pipelines/,114,,Are you against pipelines?,114,https://i.redd.it/y57zk7tdvnp21.jpg
tehForce,"Top Turds Trade jobs be like why are we invisible? Im in the trades and it's pretty great. Pays good and because the work force is so thin you have a lot more control than usual I think. At my company the start time isn't strict: I can start anywhere from 6:30 to 9:30 if I want. I can go home early pretty much anytime. I work overtime as much as I want. And if I don't like the company I'm at I could have another job in 24 hours. It's pretty incredible. To make the point for college being a cpa is great for very similar reasons. Lot of remote jobs lot of flexibility excellent pay job offerings everywhere. That said I'd consider accounting to be the closest thing to a trade that a college offers.At the end of the day it's all about learning something practical and applicable so you can support yourself. There's still plenty of ways to do that with college and the price isn't crazy. 2 years of community college + cheapest in-state college (it's a good school) will put you out about 20k here. For me it was more but I went to a private college and it was definitely worth it. Trades are the way to go. Electrician here. How do you like being a sparky? I was (still am) interested in going the electrician route but ultimately went to HVAC. Engineers might challenge your first claim. Which trade are you in? I'm a residential and commercial HVAC (Heating & Cooling) Technician. Do you mind me asking how much you make? Not at all. I grossed $78000 last year. I'm paid hourly and also get bonuses for sales leads certain service add-ons (adding customers to maintenance plans) and a profit-sharing bonus at the end of the year. I also have health insurance 401K with a 3% match a company vehicle (service van) I drive home everyday company phone (iphone 7) paid time off and paid sick days. What jobs are defined as ""trades""? It's any job that requires experience on-the-job training and often vocational training but does not require a bachelor's degree. But that meaning is often more open than what people here refer to.Mechanic machinist millright electrician plumber welders carpenters blacksmiths metalurgists pipelayers glazers etc. By no means comprehensive but gives you an idea of the kind of jobs that fit the bill. Trades:ElectriciansPlumbersPipe FittersHVACMillwrightsCarpentersEtc.Basically any job that involves physical labor as a large component of the job but also requires extensive specific skills or knowledge. What job do you do and where do you work at? I work for a medium sized residential/commercial HVAC company as a service technician. I know this sounds counterintuitive but we really need to stop encouraging people to go to college for the sake of college. Trade school is far more valuable and the jobs are less likely to be automated by robots or AI. Yeah my brother made $67k as a 3rd year apprentice last year.  So far this year he has been getting paid $40-$50/hr on most jobs.Dirty hard work but the money is there. I’m a General Contractor and the trades are all hurting for labor. No one wants to actually work anymore. Most guys try and leave after either a day or a week. Morbid curiosity but what's the wage?I've heard this before from the local shops.  Turns out they all want to pay $13-$18 an hour. Starting out with no skills as a helper maybe but you can easily work into 80-100k a year in 5-10 years depending on the trade. Sounds pretty reasonable then.  Shops all pretty much cap at $18 and teach little regarding skills so it is no surprise they can't get folks.  Keep telling my younger buddies it's not what you're working now that matters it's what you're setting up for in 5 years that you need to be thinking about.  Some of them are finally getting it. Lots of jobs get rate pay added on to their normal wage.   My brother has had jobs where his rate pay was almost double his base pay.     He only works on one site that he doesn't get rate pay for and I can't remember exactly why that place is exempt.So the base might be $18 but the rate pay might be $20/hr or $30/hr etc... So you end up making $38 or $48/hr on those sites.

willydillydoo,Too bad the actor is a bleeding heart liberal. I don’t care too much. Everybody in Hollywood has to be one. I found Ron Swanson to be a funny portrayal of a libertarian. I find myself saying things often that Swanson would say or sound like something from the show. So I can appreciate the character. Ron Swanson is my Hollywood spirit animal Ron was easily the most beloved character on the show much to their chagrin I'm sure For me it’s a “It’s funny because it’s true” type thing. One of my biggest criticisms of my fellow conservatives is that a lot of us can’t stand any character making fun of us. Ron Swanson is a good character because he’s not just some dumb idiot redneck. He plays to a lot of things we actually say and believe and it’s funny. I appreciate the character because I can be just as ridiculous as him. We need to learn to laugh at ourselves. The media made up a character that was supposed to be mocking a group of people. You saw it and agreed with it. Not sure who is right and wrong here LOL.

Something like that Yea he gave up on it a long time ago though. Yep he’s the father of the memetics theory a combination of viral imagery and pointed modern descriptive language that can propagate through collective consciousness even across generational gaps.

This is vital for the conservative cause because it’s been determined [scientifically](http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~rakison/memes.pdf) that memes “are a powerful force shaping our cultural and biological evolution” (Blackmore 2016). 

However as of 9:19 AM there have only been 10 high quality memes in this sub since the mods’ decision. Compared to how /r/Conservative unfortunately was (with over 5 articles per minute on average) that’s too low.

Therefore in order to save the world from left-wing destruction we must collectively [as individuals in a group not in a communism way because that’s homosexual; comrade Goolog] pump out memes in mass production.

TheConsoleGeek,"As a high schooler myself we don't get taught mucn good in those classes anyways. I don't think they should teach that stuff either....Because they teach it so horribly you can't remember crap afterwards. Right when you learn something they immediately jump time periods. The dates of important events get jumbled. Math? I don't remember anything except the practical stuff that I actually have to use in life and work. Gov and econ? Almost all of my knowledge is from doing my own research. The public system is garbage. I was fortunate enough to go to a (Christian) private high school that actually taught decent history English social studies and economics. However yea I did have to learn a lot of the political stuff on my own. I wish there was a better government class i could have taken however. And obviously we got religion for 13 years lol. Yeah I ""learned"" a lot of stuff if you could call it that. I wouldn't be nearly as critical of public school if they could just cut the fluff and do longer focus on the important stuff. That was the good thing about it being private. My economics teacher was brilliant and has his own business as well as being in the stocks but lost it around 2008 (shocker) he sold his business and became a teacher not to make money but to teach students about how important savings 401k etc etc is.He took it a step further by implementing a trades class (trade academy) for people who weren’t going to go to college. My high school was a college prep school and didn’t like the idea and it almost got shut down but I’m glad it didn’t.In an age where everyone is told they need to go to high school it was refreshing to hear that i didn’t. We got WATC certified and learned some neat stuff. A friend of mine literally came out of high school and the next year was earning a $65000 a year. But yea Teachers there could usually voice how they felt about issues like that since it wasn’t a public school completely controlled by the gov. I had sufficient knowledge of basic information on how government works in high school. I just didn’t care until I saw the real effects when I graduated. Because they teach it so horribly you can't remember crap afterwards.You are lucky if they don't outright substitute it with some heavily revisioned liberal version of it. My Econ class is literally just about 1700-1800s politics. It’s honestly the worst class I’ve ever had. I'm actually in econ right now and it's not that bad but it's slow af. I've passed everything without actually doing the work so far since I know most of it already. These classes are extremly bloated. High school could be 2 years and you'd get the same amount of useful knowledge. Facts. It doesn’t help that every Econ teacher seemingly hates their job and that class. My econ teacher just doesn't care. He's fine but really doesn't care since he's had his job so long it's safe for him to do the bare minimum. In my school we had to have 2 years of art or music. As I am neither artistic nor musically talented I did what everyone else in my situation did and joined chorus. You get an automatic B unless you really really shine or really really fuck up. 2 years of tine I could have had additional time in match English biology or better basic chemistry. Or a class that teaches you the basics like taxes or how to shop frugally. Schools need to either cut everything but basic subjects OR use the current allotted time to allow kids to specialize in what they like. Get kids started on things they enjoy young so they can get started earlier in the world with skills they enjoy and can use. Yeah let's not teach them anything That is already the case right now. Be a good way to save a lot of money. Fuck I would have taken a legit personal finance class at the very least if I could. Emotional decision making is immature. You bought a car because it's new and fancy? That's an immature decision. Went to an out of state college because you wanted to explore? Emotional decision. Going into debt because you needed those fancy new shoes and that expensive prom dress is a tell tale sign that you are not ready to survive and thrive in the real world.The less emotional decisions you make the better your life will become. Liberals do all those things then blame other people for their decisions Which further proves my point.  Emotional decision making often leads to emotional defense of that decision making the most immature of which being deflect and divert.

That look of triumph and accomplishment in that mentally ill mans eyes is kind of pathetic. Kinda reminds me of that scene in The Hot Chick when Rob Schneider gets in a pillow fight with the girls and knocks them all out without realizing it. Back then.. Comedy gold.. Today.. a reality.Political correctness also smashed the genre of Comedy. Cant remember the last time I saw a good comedy flick.  They do not exist anymore.Hi My name is Terry This is just ridiculous. No shit a man won the woman's lifting competition. Men are naturally bigger and stronger than women. That is completely unfair. Imagine what will happen in the 2020 Olympics if one country busts out a bunch of transgender people to stomp the women's sports. There are going to be problems that will arise because of this.

They are there to bring attention to the issue of biological males identifying as females and competing with biological women. You can donate to them to help their cause on their website. What a hero... I still don't understand how any of this makes sense.  How can men compete in women's sports?  Better yet why would women allow men to compete against them? There are four lights!

Nice appeal to authority.The Reagan Boom - Greatest Ever](https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/17/opinion/the-reagan-boom-greatest-ever.html) Just because someone cites the source of their information doesn't mean they've committed a logical fallacy.  People who are generally quick to reference fallacies tend to not be people who've actually studied logic or philosophy. Scholars disagree with you. Hopefully you're being sarcastic.  As an example of my point if it were the case that ""scholars"" presented whatever sound argument or evidence in this context to actually imply ""no people who respond with names of fallacies are actually right every time"" that would not be fallacious.  Similarly if a person's limited intellect were relevant to an argument then it wouldn't be ad hominem to denote it.  To assume otherwise is to 'commit' ""the fallacy fallacy"".  It's the philosophy major equivalent of a freshman psych major diagnosing everyone they meet with some personality disorder etc.Edit: But by all means if you want to try using symbolic logic to argue against the assertion that Reaganomics is a myth/failed/harmful economic model go for it.

Willrocks650,"When you go to a liberal college and get your liberal arts degree from liberal professors and wind up making shit for money so you turn to socialism on the radical left to make it so that everyone makes shit for money. Maybe minimum wage is more livable for people who aren't having the extra expense of paying down student loans that went toward their degree on the History of Transgendered Ethnic Minorities in Venezuela degree while using their latest iPhone to bitch about how the minimum wage isn't livable. But in all seriousness if you’re going to get a useless degree to look hip and woke don’t be surprised when you can’t get a decent job then bitch when you realize you actually have to work your entitled ass to make money in this day and age. But alas the left has their heads buried in the “everyone should be given enough money to live!” Mentality. Meritocracy is bad according to the left probably because it means that people actually have to be responsible for bettering themselves in stead of earning social good boy points. Meritocracy is bad according to the left because the left is mostly a youth movement based off inexperience and naiveté. They have nothing of merit to offer yet other than ""compassion and emotions"". Hence why most people get more conservative the older they get. They begin contributing things to society and learning that it's not as easy as mom and dad made it look. They begin to EARN things and learn that things EARNED have more value than those given and are more reluctant to let others take what they have earned. What the left doesn't understand is that not only is the world itself a meritocracy but it's the most inclusive system. No amount of prejudice or bigotry can keep someone from doing push-ups to improve themselves physically. No prejudice can keep someone from cracking a book to learn. And in a true meritocracy the most qualified person will have their qualifications outweigh any trivial thing like the color of their skin or what is between their legs and they will succeed because they took the time to hone themselves. Success I a meritocracy takes effort and will to improve oneself. The responsibility to be a better person is why the left doesn't like it. It's not instantly gratifying enough. Yes.

This guy is living in 3019 Yeah you can't get that glue off it looks gross Of course it’s a Cali plate This sounds terribly judgemental but if I see someone with bumper stickers I trust them just a little bit less. I’ve owned two cars. I’ve never put stickers on either of them and I never will. I don’t like to be noticed and possibly targeted. On laptops too I enjoyed bumper stickers when I was younger. I had one that I was really proud of. Now I think bumper stickers look tacky. Buying Apple products made me appreciate a minimalist appearance. It shows the mentality of the owner on so many levels.  I'm not saying not only liberals use bumper stickers.  But they usually put them on foreign cars right on the paint.  A conservative usually has a few select stickers on the rear glass so it doesn't obstruct the view and can be removed with a razor blade for resale.Most of all.

ngoni,Here is a break down of the facts it's Forbes so it not a liberal source or anything:https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2018/12/09/no-the-u-s-is-not-a-net-exporter-of-crude-oil/#633d75b84ac1Relevant section:So the Bloomberg headline results from a net crude oil import number of 4.0 million BPD and a net finished product export number of 4.2 million BPD. So indeed when you consider crude oil and finished products for the week ending 11/30/18 the U.S. was a net exporter of 0.2 million BPD of crude plus finished products. (For perspective this average over the previous four weeks was 2.0 million BPD of net imports). So let me get this straight: The US is not a net exporter of crude oil because they exported more crude oil than they imported. Yeah that sounds about right. So no we imported more crude than we exported:U.S. crude oil imports - 7.2 million BPDU.S. crude oil exports - 3.2 million BPDWhich was a net of 4 million BPD ImportedThe finished products:U.S. finished product imports - 1.6 million BPDU.S. finished product exports - 5.8 million BPDWhich is a net of 4.2 million BPD ExportedThe Bloomberg articles states we're a net exporter because we net imported 4 million BPD crude and exported a net of 4.2 million BPD refinedIt took more than one read through to get what the Forbes article is trying to say  I admit domestic production is a lot higher than I was expecting.Edit: So it looks like the net positive of the crude imports to finished exports would not be sustainable and was likely a single blip possibly excess refined products being sold.  Also consumption was higher than domestic production so we're still using more than we are producing. All of this is way over my head and I admit I am having a hard time following it. However if we are using more than we are producing then we need to keep working on that. Obama was the worse President ever Obama was a fucking disgrace and a waste of 8 years. But he kowtow to other nations and acted presidential! You mean the one with a name like terrorist who is in bed with shady groups linked to terrorism? Who would have thought? IKR? Fooled me!/s for the blind To support domestic oil producers in December of 2015 under Obamathe US lifted it’s 40-year ban on oil exports. The US had previously exported only to Canada.Total US oil exports have since soared. Rising oil exports are just another Obama trend (like falling unemployment) that Trump and his ignorant followers take credit for.

_Crow_Away_Account_,"This part of his decision is fantasticThe State argues that smaller magazines create a “critical pause” in the shooting of a mass killer. “The prohibition of LCMs helps create a ‘critical pause’ that has been proven to give victims an opportunity to hide escape or disable a shooter.” Def. Oppo. at 19. This may be the case for attackers. On the other hand from the perspective of a victim trying to defend her home and family the time required to re-load a pistol after the tenth shot might be called a “lethal pause” as it typically takes a victim much longer to re-load (if they can do it at all) than a perpetrator planning an attack. In other words the re-loading “pause” the State seeks in hopes of stopping a mass shooter also tends to create an even more dangerous time for every victim who must try to defend herself with a small-capacity magazine. The need to re-load and the lengthy pause that comes with banning all but small-capacity magazines is especially unforgiving for victims who are disabled or who have arthritis or who are trying to hold a phone in their off-hand while attempting to call for police help. The good that a re-loading pause might do in the extremely rare mass shooting incident is vastly outweighed by the harm visited on manifold law-abiding citizen-victims who must also pause while under attack.Page 74 of the brief: https://d3uwh8jpzww49g.cloudfront.net/sharedmedia/1510684/2064261_2019-03-29-order-granting-plaintiffs_-msj.pdf Wow. As a centrist I have never heard of this line of reasoning. Very persuasive. Seriously though. It amounts to 'the criminal doesn't have to obey the law why should the victim?' I mean yes I have heard of that but never in this specific instance (banning medium-capacity rounds) nor in this exact way. Context and eloquence go a long way to persuading someone. Usually I hear people on both sides parroting points with neither. :P Now to take you one step further: this issue started when leftists highjacked language.The didn't ban ""high capacity magazines."" The lied and started calling standard magazines ""high capacity"" so they could start scaring people. Now people in CA who obey the law were forced to use under-sized magazines and shocker good people got hurt.Now ask yourself why we've gone from the correct term: illegal alien and moved to illegal immigrant to migrant to just plain immigrant. It's to confuse the issue when you talk about immigration. sounds exactly like us trying to get through the thick dumbfuck skulls of leftists the past few years victim trying to defend her home and familyevery victim who must try to defend herself with a small-capacity magazine.Not sure how I feel about the gendering here. On one hand guns are force equalizers and give the smallest women a good chance against the biggest men; on the other feels unnessecary men can be attacked too and might open a sexism angle to challenge this. Many women are armed because they can't overpower a man with physical force I think using a woman as an example is perfectly fine and illustrates a necessary point. We should have our most vulnerable in mind when we review law and that not only includes kids being shot at in a mass shooting but a single mother trying to fend off a would be attacker. I think it's fine because you get people saying ""you don't need a gun just give them your wallet"". Pointing out that maybe they want to rape and murder you instead of take your cash can be a good thing. ""I don't get why someone needs the death sentence just because they are trying to steal your TV."" - people who vote Democrat and happen to live in extraordinarily safe neighborhoods.It's because people don't walk around with magic signs above their heads that tell you what they are going to do. There are 0 safe ways to find out what would happen next if you let a home invader do whatever they want. You have to shoot for your own safety. You can't have a forthright conversation with an intruder and then only shoot him if he confesses he's there to kill you.Also ""I was just going to steal the TV"" is what anyone would say too if they were planning on raping someone and got shot. It’s just a stylistic choice to use the feminine when talking about a general person. Some prefer the masculine others the feminine most whatever their teacher taught them in grade school. I believe Spanish actually does that. So it may be a carry over from his birth language. Been a few years since high school Spanish 101. The case centered around a woman trying to defend herself and the small magazine cap allowing her and her husband to get shot. I’m guessing he just uses “her” because of the case tied to the ban challenge. That makes a hell of a lot more sense appreciate the response r/caguns is going mad. Every store is running out of stock. I am praying to our Lord and Saviour John Moses Browning that my magazines can start their safe passage to their new home here in California soon.

Free shit reeeeee He looks like he had to actually pay for that coffee and his life is ruined. Bernie is MAGA! Making Alzheimer's Great Again! No idea how this post ended up on my home page with only 97 upvotes. However...I’m a middle of the lane sort of guy. But when I see this on r/conservative ... honestly it just looks like the light version of TD. You guy look like crazy folk to most normal people reading this.Every comment so far is a high school level insult. Not a single critical thought just straight up “hey let’s all be a dick to this man that is passionate about improving our country”Whether or not you agree with his fiscal policy I just get the impression conservatives are just mindless sheep now. It’s sad because conservatives used to be intellectually well reasoned. Now it’s just desperate “lulz AOC is dumb” and “hur hur Bernie is dumb lolololol”.I suspect this is actually because the intelligent conservatives have left the chat and we’re kind of left with bottom of the barrel hillbilly alcoholics. Now that just a guess and probably a bit rude of me to say but to be honest I’m just trying to report the vibe you all give off from somebody that likely would never vote Bernie. This meme made you feel all of that? Nobody in their right mind thinks Bernie has his own ideas. He's a puppet and it was exposed in the email leaks. He was a mascot for the Democrat party.its funny how 'middle ground' people pop up whenever Bernie gets brought up even if the meme sucks it offends them lolr/conservative is dead as hell but when you mention Bernie the 'moderates' come popping up with very opinionated pieces lmao I don't think the far left radicals should be taken seriously. No reason to normalize them. Mockery is the way to go. I can understand why you take this position but I disagree.The treatment of the democrats at the hands of the republicans is going to cause the democrats to hit back twice as hard. It’s not a good long term strategy.  Also- it’s manufactured. People are profiting off partisanship which gives them the incentive to create more partisanship.It breaks down civility and distracts everyone from fixing real issues.Look at the border for example. Trumps #1 agenda. Border crossings have only increased. After decades of steadily decreasing they have gone sharply up. So what do you think of r/politics It’s sad because conservatives used to be intellectually well reasoned.Well even I'm Chinese I knew that's total bullshit. No one in or out of the conservatives' camp tried to paint conservatives as intellectually superior - if anything conservatives boast of having common sense something you need to go to college to lose a great deal of and to get a phd to purge completely.It's the liberals who tried so hard to paint themselves as super-intelligent demi-gods. And ended up doing so bad a job that the term ""libtard"" stuck forever while nothing equivalent could be found denoting the other side.This is not a serious post. Because the subject of the post isn't a serious human being - if a human being at all. if a human being at allDehumanizing a patriot? Wow you’re a real stand up guy. This isn’t China. We don’t dehumanize people here. Bernie is the traitor of the first order he's very much loud and proud regarding his own radical leftwing views. He is a patriot perhaps to Soviet Russia not America in any sense of the word how you managed to convince yourself anything else is beyond reason.Also don't forget that he and his supporters wouldn't bat an eye if they get the chance to make you kneel before a short wall and put a gun to your head and pull the trigger. They are not creatures worthy of the title ""humans"" they are critters the unfortunate product of random combination of genetics. Lol ok bro 👌🏼 👍🏼Wanting healthcare for people who can’t afford it (basically everybody can’t afford it even the wealthy would go bankrupt without insurance) = evil dictator to you?I don’t agree with his methods but he obvioisly has a good heartYou. Are. Radicalized.This isn’t an insult. It’s just reality. Honestly its stuff like this that makes me frequent the comments. I’m not high karma enough to pass muster but its good to find a principles conservative online Not a single critical thoughtAs of today r/conservative is now a meme sub & r/conservativearticles is the sub for serious discussion. Inflation is a made up thing He already gave up air travel to keep the swamp banshee AOC happy lmao... TIME TO MAKE THE DONUTS At least he knows about the 1% .

optionhome,"Sounds like a talking point she never investigated. Like the rest of what she says. She doesn't investigate anything. This bullshit is fed to her by the Justice Democrats. The problem is that she can't keep what they tell her to say straight and she constantly screws it up. That's why it's always nonsensical garbage spewing out of her. She has a whole team of aides skimming talking points straight from far left reddit subs.Almost every single one of her points people go nuts for I’ve read before almost verbatim on here.Turns out they don’t fact check much... She's too stupid to insult and it seems democrats have lowered their standards again They've shown their true colours and publicly become radicalized. I disagree.  She's too stupid to realize you're insulting her sure but there's no such thing as stupidity beyond reproach. have lowered their standards againOther than double standards I'm not aware that the liberals have any? This type of ignorance has become irrelevant.  When the dems and lying liberal media spew constant lies it is the perfect environment for assholes like this to spew wrong information....because who cares when your audience is other morons just like you. They didn't amend it to stop F-Dead-R from getting reelected. They amended it to stop someone like FDR from getting power and staying. Remember FDR is someone Benito Mussolini literally said he idolized as a model fascist and a great dictator with more power in America than Mussolini dreamed he could have in Italy.Now we just need Congressional term limits to make sure Senators like Feinstein can't give the Chinese decades of access to our innermost workings. They amended it to stop someone like FDR from getting power and staying.Every history class I ever had glossed over this so hard it's like the two things weren't even related. FDR should be a cautionary tale not a hero. I remember in US history they talked about how the New deal was working and how the recession ended at the start of WW2. Being confused at that statement I asked the teacher so the recession ended because we got into a war not because of the New deal. He sheepishly admitted that was correct.It wasn't until year's later that I found out that the New deal was failing and FDR is a scoundrel who threatened to pack the courts because he wasn't getting his way. The TVA is still a thing.  Let that sink in a temporary government public works program to help get us out of the Great Depression is still going nearly a century later.  Milton Friedman was right there is no more permanent thing than a temporary government program. Can we please stop making every mental fart of her's front page news? We already know she's not a Grade A student in American politics. That's exactly what she ran on. Her rabid supporters will dismiss it as as silly nitpicking but will take note that she's ""really getting under the fascist's skin"" and her fame/infamy will grow a little more.It's the exact same publicity cycle Trump takes advantage of. The only difference is that he's actually had some accomplishments in his life while she's leaning entirely on big promises and keeping her name in the spotlight. Take that away and she has nothing left. be-be-because ORANGE MAN BAD!!! You forgot to REEEEEE! Here's the sad part we think this stupidity will cost her 2020 but the problem is her voter base is just as stupid as she is and will think what she's saying is true. We will now have a ton of young millennial liberals going around spreading this false information. I mean she’s a democrat in one of the deepest blue districts in the country. No one can reasonably think she isn’t getting re-elected.Millennials aren’t as young as you think btw.

Clatsop,Basement Brigade “You can’t butter your crumpet because some wanker stabbed a guy” -UK actually Do you have license to say that? Oi mate do you have a permit to check his loicense? You’re not my king! I didn’t vote for you! You don't vote for king! Help help I'm being oppressed! Funny you should say that as infact the monarchy is a prime example of uneven distribution of wealth. In effect all land in the UK is owned by the crown and in the case of no heir to a plot of land it is defaulted to the crown.The Norman conquest of England in 1066 saw all land taken under the  ownership of the monarchy. To this day the monarchy - in theory at least  - owns all the land. The Normans changed the ownership of land with the  King giving land as tribute to Norman lords and barons and depriving  the Saxons. The Domesday book was the first audit of land. And the  resulting system of feudalism exacted free labour goods and produce and  free military service to the land-owning classes for the rest of the  middle ages.The Diggers sought to challenge the ‘Norman Yoake’ and return the  land to common people. As one Diggers’ pamphlet proclaimed ‘Seeing that  the common people of England by joint consent of person and purse have  caste out Charles our Norman oppressor we have by this victory  recovered ourselves from under this Norman yoake…and the land is to be  held no longer from the use of them [the commoners]’ Their attempts to  build communal farms were persecuted by local landowners and the Diggers  were dispersed. The Diggers obtained nothing from the new Republic  which eagerly sold off Church and Royalist land – the spoils of war – to  its own loyal aristocrats. The redistribution of land was so enormous  that Charles II under the Restoration could not undo the redefined  status quo.From the get-go it was de facto a case of being so wealthy as to dictate every aspect of a countries day-to-day life and policy both domestic and foreign that made the monarchy possible. I don't think you should use the UK as an example if you want to make fun of even distribution of wealth... You don’t vote for kings! I dont think that's how it works Lol right? Imagine knowing so little that you think this is a good analogy. Like there's a finite amount of horsepower out there and someday we're gonna use it all up. Or thinking the body has a finite amount of energy and once used up you die so your fatass rides in golf carts everywhere instead of doing even the most miniscule amount of walking and absolutely refuse to exercise. You'd have to be a real fucking dumbass to believe something that ludicrous. Is there a finite amount of wealth that we will someday use up? Well yes. The sum amount of wealth in the world is finite at any given point. It grows over time but if one small part of the population owns most of that growth the rest of us won't see much benefit. That's how you get something like this where despite significant real economic growth most people haven't seen an according growth of pay. You know what would be an even better graph? One that shows the line graph of GDP over time and distributes the colour below the line on how much the top 1% have owned as a % of that GDP. Where would I find the data to make this graph?Edit: like this graph but with GDP data over the last 100 years https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javafx/images/depicting_area_chart.jpg It's also not what progressives think lol Some people can’t use their first amendment right because others are speaking too much. You saying mean words infringes on my rights to speak. OMG HATESPEECH!!

HTownTexas,"""Anyone that disagrees with me is a white supremacist"" Apparently I'm the first brown skinned brown eyed black haired Catholic son of Mexican immigrants white supremacist.Huh figures. racist racistEverything is racist “Catholic” See that’s where they got you buddy boy. You’re officially a white supremacist now Deus Vult! Deus malum sit Deus magnus est Nvm Google Translate is dumbGod damn it. apparently = Deus Malum sit! =God is wrong? Latin Mass is a hell of a drug. Implying that you have to be white to be a white supremacist?  Racist.  Therefore you are a white supremacist. Alec Baldwin was on the Howard Stern Show this past week she said of Trump supporters:“They support him because he’s a racist... because they are racists. The president is a white supremacist. “ when I ask liberals how Trump is a racist they can never seem to find any examples. weird They always point to the same NYT opinion piece where bis accountant from the 80s said he was racist. You really think letting a black guy do your finances is something a racist would do? Then a quote of trump calling mecicans animals except hes referring to a group that gangraped a girl in central park. Lastly my favorite example of Trump racism was firing someone black on the Apprentice. Not letting a black guy win is racist. Its absolutely insane. It's weird. They make us look for every black or brown person Trump has ever worked or done business with when it shouldn't really matter. Obviously they don't want to do the work. They can find out for themselves but it makes us seem like we're looking for the token person all the time.It'll make both sides look bad sooner or later. I always love how a racist still manages to be friends with blacks. I don't think the Klan is hanging out with black people because racist people don't like other races. Pretty simple logic. And if they do it’s the lies like he said Nazis are fine people or that all Mexicans are rapists. I have the same issue Voxlol 1988: In a commencement speech at Lehigh University Trump spent much of his speech accusing countries like Japan of “stripping the United States of economic dignity.” This matches much of his current rhetoric on China.Yeah! You can't criticize Asia's impact on our economy. That's somehow...racist! It’s crazy. Reading through that list is hilarious how far they have to reach to try and “prove” racism. Vox tell me Trump racist. I never consider other side of story because Vox know all. I can always trust Vox to give me unbiased takes. Thank you Vox! You've absolutely shown me the error of my ways. Wow Haha try again. I like Bill Burr's response to that.""So the racist stayed home when Obama was running but came out to vote against the old white woman because they hate minorities?""

I keep saying that instead of changing the damn electoral college Democrats could go and try to appeal to voters from midwest states. That would entail playing fair. It’s already pretty sure he’ll win Yes but we can’t get cocky The Democrats were certain Clinton would win. Difference being they were wrong Yeah I think the miscalculation for the Democrats is that they abandoned the midwest before demographics will turn Arizona Georgia and Texas blue. They'll try to recapture the midwest in 2020 but I think they'll fail.  Trumps trade and immigration policies are a hell of a lot more popular here than open borders and transgenderism. That's a failed strategy also given George Bush got 44% of the Hispanic strategy they're not going to get more liberal. Yeah actually all evidence shows that later generations of Hispanics start to have more political diversity than first and second generation.  Also as Hispanics see increased economic success in the next few decades — the Democrats’ socialist nonsense will ring hollow to taxpaying Hispanics worried about sending their kids to college and paying the mortgage. It's exactly how things started turning in the South. First they started voted Dem local and Rep national then they started voting straight ticket. What’s wild is that it took 80 years. The first cracks in the Democrat south appeared in the 1920s the Eisenhower won a good amount of the South. Then Nixon blew it open and the rest is history.But actually a lot of the South’s political changes had to do with the South’s changing economy. Southerners started voting Republican as the New South economy sprang to life and it become a vibrant powerhouse of entrepreneurism and attractive to bigger companies as well.  As wages increased so did the number of Southerners who paid taxes and didn’t fully utilize government programs. Yeah I mean first time I voted was for Bernie and I'm firmly on the Trump 2020 wagon.I didn't leave the Democratic party the Democratic party left me.Edit: I actually just realized I was conservative 🤷‍♂️ Welcome we are a big tent Right there with ya. Voting for Bernie and believing his bullshit is one of my biggest regrets. Embarrassing. Democrats think they can keep beating their blue dogs and they will keep coming back. Dems ought to be sweating bullets right now. That state is so close to being Trump’s and having a republican senator. Blue dogs So a curious fact I didn't realize is that 19 states do not register voters by party. Michigan is one of them so I start wondering about this number claimed.Parscale says he was able to extrapolate this data by cross checking the phone numbers that attendees gave when signing up with voter registration. This would not be possible for Michigan given the fact above.So how could this number be true and significant for Michigan? Did a large swath of registered Democrats come in from other states in such numbers that it would account for 1/3 of the crowd?Looking again at the state map of who registers parties it would mean they came pretty far since all of the states bordering Michigan also do not register by party.If still true somehow it means this number is useless for assessing the trend in Michigan for one. All of these theoretical registered Democrats would have come from somewhere else. We just can’t stop winning. Ohhh boy. This election is gonna be juicy. You must have a pretty boring life. Oh shit!

optionhome,I really couldn't care less about a politician's tax returns being released. It's not as if the general public would take the time to read them let alone understand them. I really couldn't care less about a politician's tax returns being released.Think about this....Trump is a business guy.  He made his money legally in the real world of business.  Politicians magically become millionaires on a set salary.  Bernie and the rest do not want anyone actually being able to figure out how they became so rich being an elected official It’s not magic. On the legal side of things speaking engagements and appearances can earn quite a bit of money. The question is are hey paying taxes on the money. It’s not a question for me though.Demanding that people pay money to the government if there’s a legal means for them not to is not a play toward morality. That’s like saying you’re immoral for not floating the bill on thousands of pointless projects way over priced and incredibly wasteful some of which are pretty objectionable morally. Lower the need for taxation to begin with. Many times all those speaking fees are pay for play. Oh come on.  That 20 minute speech that HIlliary Rodham Rodham Clinton Rodham gave to Goldman Sachs. was absolutely worth a quarter million. Congress is legally allowed to profit off of insider trading that the rest of the public would be thrown in jail for see Martha Stewart. They couldn't prove that charge so they threw the old 1001 lying to Federal officials charge at her along with other great prosecutor standbys like obstruction and conspiracy.https://www.foxnews.com/story/martha-stewart-convicted-on-all-four-counts It’s not magic.No it isn't.  Its corruption. So why hasn’tTrump released his tax returns if it’s all legal? Gotta go both ways Pretty simple. He doesn't have to and has nothing to gain from it.Take for example John Kerrey and Mitt Romney. Both had about the same earnings when running for office but Romney actually donated much more to charity. Their tax rate was also extremely similar. Guess who the media ignored and who the media attacked. Are you trying to imply the media might be... biased?!?!? Let's make everyone's tax returns public.Why not? Feeling guilty about something you did?This is a stupid way to gauge whether someone is fit for office. Not everyone but the ones that are running for the office of President of United States! you know the most powerful position in the whole planet! So your idea is that the more powerful the position the more rights you must give up? Yeah! Why not!?If You want to be the people's leader let people get to know you well! They need to know who you are and how you became who you are today! I dont think this is too much to ask! doesnt matter D or R or I whoever wants to be the President SHOULD release their tax! you are not applying for a graphic designer position at XYZ Graphics!It's the fucking President of US! <== Shapes the face of the whole planet! dont you think you have the right to know everything about him/her before giving him/her the key to the kingdome? Yeah. This.It's a worthy trade-off. Millions of people have to depend upon these leaders. Their precious privacy can wait until AFTER they're no longer holding entire nations hostage. No one asked them to run for the Office it's their choice! this should be a package!If you truely believe you are worthy of holding the office let the people find that confidence in you as well! No one would run for office if this were reality. Or don't you believe the IRS can do their job? What about everyone inside the president's cabinet? What about those in line of succession of the president? What about judges? Both state and federal? Aren't they the ones that really need to be looked at for conflicts? What about every CEO CFO and VP of every fortune 500 company? There's always dirty money there. What about governors? They play a much larger roll on every citizen's day to day life than any President. What about all 23and 4 star generals? NO Just the President. The system was designed based on check and balances! anyone between cabinet and admin will get exposed if there is something shady! But it's only the President that can technically overturn and veto that other 520 representatives voted for(Veto power Chief Commander...) His/Her power is way beyond anyone else in the government.CEO CFO... yeah but over there you vote with your Money. Buying their products/service or investing in the company!

chabanais,"J K Rowling pulls the same shit. Doesn’t she have like a 25 bedroom home or something? I remember her tweeting about letting migrants into the country and giving them housing someone responded she should offer up one of her 25 bedrooms and was met with pure silence. There was also gofundme for it Yeah shes horrible ""Do as I say  not as I do"" I thought that Democrats were for the ""homeless"" Only if they are in another place. Don’t wanna..give them a home. Looks like they aren’t as progressive as they claim to be. I agree fervently. As long as they don't have to...ew ""interact"" with them.  Had a wonderful conversation on r/cars of all places about how they view people that shop at certain stores as the ""trash of society.""  Classism is absolutely real in America. That's how socialists roll. They divide the lower classes into race to keep them fighting with each other for the scraps the rich liberals are willing to occasionally drop off the table. Which stores? I would love to read this. Someone's car got keyed at a walmart in a nice neighborhood and most of the responses were ""shouldn't have gone to walmart.""  People proudly proclaiming they'd rather go to target to avoid the ""trash of society"" that shops at walmart etc.If the average person that shops at a chain you can find in pretty much any neighborhood wealthy or poor is the ""trash of society"" then I guess a lot of society is trash.It's just weird for me to see the vitriol because my family was (relatively) affluent and on my own now I'm middle class and I'd never gotten that kind of impression before. Ha we got hit and run at a Whole Foods in New Jersey.It’s actually very common for smug jerks to hit employees and other cars there. You can only be for the homeless if they don’t have homes.... I think you all need to look into this further.The homeless shelter is being proposed by the democrat led Mayor London Breed.The counter-fund is made largely of anonymous donors and the money is going to someone who I couldn't find any political affiliation.The counter-counter-fund against the one linked to has raised a lot more money is run by a local and most of the big donors are obviously liberal eg. Jack Dorsey. Marc Benioff donated too and while he's not either conservative or liberal he did publicly vote for H. Clinton at the 2016 election... but still overall it's hard to guess who the majority are.Both the left and the right have a problem with finding a few bad eggs and assuming the rest are all the same. In this case you're assuming the people against it are liberals without anything to go on other than how that area voted then insulting their entire supporter base when it's pretty clear most of them are still in favour of it going ahead. San Francisco votes 80-90% left every election I seriously doubt they found the one 10% area.Liberals are all about helping as long as they dont have to interact or see the lower classes. So if I were to provide an example of liberals donating their time / money / etc to help people worse off than them you'd change your opinion? They don't care about the poor they just hate the rich. ? Just because it’s San Francisco doesn’t mean everyone is a democrat Okay maybe it's just that you don't know anything about San Francisco. It pretty much does mean they're almost all Democrats Liberals are all about helping as long as they dont have to interact or see the lower classes.

She doesn't give a shit about the people in her district because that's not her job. It's not what she was hired to do.  I think this is the part that the Justice Democrats didn't think about.  However I think this is their first shot at it and they're trying to work out the kinks.  They're going to have to get the people they install into these positions to actually play the part or this isn't going to work for them.Edit: Here's the TYT response to the Mr. Reagan video about AOC.  In typical progressive fashion they label it ""destroying conservative's conspiracy about AOC"" but don't ""destroy"" anything. It's just a typical condescending leftist talking down to everyone and that somehow makes her right and ""destroys"" the theory.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDgMxb1Ow70 has she done any work at all for her district? If I was campaigning against her I would be focusing on that more than anything else.It's great that she wants to champion the entire country with her bullshit agenda but her district is not going to be happy when they have problems that need to be fixed. I can only imagine the bronx has some serious problems. She can't claim that New York is racist against her district because she would be part of the problem. Yes she has done some work for the people of New York.  She took credit for killing a deal that would have brought 25000 good paying jobs but then again she is a socialist.  Socialists do not want people working at capitalist jobs they want them on government assistance voting for socialists. She literally thought the state was going to pay Amazon $3B to come to New York.  Her bullshit economics degree couldn't help her figure out that was a tax break Amazon was getting for creating those jobs which in turn would employ people who would pay taxes (her salary).  She said now that they weren't paying Amazon they could put that money into infrastructure.https://www.ccn.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-cringeworthy-reaction-to-amazons-hq2-pullout-proves-how-out-of-touch-she-really-is It’s not even a special tax break. It’s the Excelsior tax break that’s available to any business that moves to NY State. To be fair there were some breaks in there that were not available to everyone. A lot of them were though.

Perfectly ignorant with just the right amount of smug She really is deranged. To be honest I'm surprised to hear that she (apparently) now has a district office because the last I heard about that was that she hadn't bothered to take over the previous Reps district office and was being real slow to get one. Couldn't make it through the first minute. As soon as they said she's been incredibly effective so far I had to turn it off.It astounds me how idiotic these people sound. They live in an imaginary bubble. It's like they all took some hallucinogens and are tripping balls. Lol the second I saw that womans face the first thing I thought of was the 2016 TYT election night meltdown vid. That's my immediate association about her. Just noticed “Justice Democrats” and TYT mentioned in this post.Does anyone realize the Justice Dems are so far left they kicked Cenk Uyger out even though he founded them?“We do not feel that Mr. Uygur is fit to lead or participate in an organization that truly believes women’s issues and the issues of black and brown people are all of our issues.”https://www.huffpost.com/entry/justice-democrats-ousts-cenk-uygur_n_5a3eb4d1e4b025f99e178181 Translation: ""he's a straight white guy and that is unacceptable"" lol eating their own. That wasn't why they booted him. They booted him because he got caught in a controversy similar to the one Joy Reid got caught in with past writings not fitting with the right -isms and -ists that they subscribe to. His excuse was that he was ""right wing at the time."" She doesn't give a shit about the people in her district because that's not her job. It's not what she was hired to do. I think this is the part that the Justice Democrats didn't think about. However I think this is their first shot at it and they're trying to work out the kinksThis is Democrat national policy in action: hammer on wedge issues in order to gain power.The thing is that most people want representatives FROM their district representing THEIR INTERESTS. You know the function of government not the functions of power. Her argument is that she's saying that what he thought what he was saying was a conspiracy. She didn't argue that anything he said wasn't true. I've done enough research on this particular issue and the groups and people involved to know that what he said is basically true. However I don't look at what they're doing as an evil conspiracy but as a method to steal from and use ourselves. The real person to be paying attention to is Becky Bond even more than Zack Exley everyone involved in Justice Democrats are brainchildren of her work. I thought she was hired to make Democrats look bad. It’s a deep blue district and as we know less people bother to turn out to vote in the primary. 28000 people voted out of a population of 690000. She got 15800 votes.However now with her explicit support of socialism thousands of Albanians and Greeks in her district that actually experienced that ideology are motivated to vote her out. Am Albanian can confirm we hate her This is the key. She won with a record low turnout and now they miss Tommy. I bet they show up next time. I hope the next election people actually come out in force. Any candidate just needs to focus on the local issues AOC has ignored as well as point out her total flaws in the Amazon deal.Sienna College recently did a poll and most people in her district now view her unfavorably.My only concern is Justice Democrats doing what they do best by committing election fraud to ensure AOC wins.

chabanais,"For years Chris rock has made great efforts and has done a job at productively adding to the conversation about race in America. That doesn’t mean I agree with him about everything but he is very good at making points in a way that people understand and he often does that in a way that allows people to laugh. One of the things that he did that I absolutely love was remake Death at a Funeral with a mostly black cast. It’s a great movie based on a great movie but it’s also really interesting in that he wanted to make a movie about black people in which blackness wasn’t the driving factor of the movie. It’s very humanizing and very well cast. His last comedy special was a clusterfuck of unfunny virtue signaling. He's done some good stuff but he's far from an ally. He’s not perfect and I’m not asking him to an ally. He simply has had a lot offer over the years. That should be appreciated. This title is confusing. Rock was instructed to not tell Smollett jokes but he did anyway. Why can't news headlines just be as straightforward as you are? Maybe they were trying to garner clicks from people who sit on both sides of the issue They need the clicks. Especially the gateway pundit. They love their fake news headlines. It reads as if Chris Rock told no Smollett jokes. Not Chris Rock told “No Smollett jokes”. Comedian Chris Rock told ""No Smollet Jokes"" at NAACP AwardsSince the word ""told"" has two definitions this fix would remove any ambiguity. I helped my Uncle Jack off the horse. Lmao good oneComedian Chris Rock told NO Smollet jokes at NAACP AwardsComedian Chris Rock told no Smollet jokes at NAACP AwardsComedian Chris Rock told zero Smollet jokes at NAACP AwardsAll of these sentences mean the same thing You... you... homophone.I don't know who was more surprised... my uncle or the horse.And those sentences don't all necessarily mean the same thing... It doesn’t say “was told” English is a neat language and you’re using it wrong.. I thought we were still discussing the title. My bad you’re using it wrong..Well you may have meant that but that's not what you actually said.See... English is a language you do need to pay attention. Typical Reddit butthurt.  It's hilarious the things that get up their little rectums. Ok but the thing is you can’t understand the sentence as you are reading it. It isn’t until after the “-“ that it’s clear which way it’s supposed to be read.It could also be read that he didn’t tell any jokes but still trashed him. Well yea it’s possible to understand it but obviously there’s some confusion or initial confusion. It’s objectively better if you don’t have to go back and reread it to understand it. As it is it’s 50/50 whether you have to or not. Or the headline could have been anything else that’s 100 times more clear:“Rock prohibited from telling Smollett jokes does anyway” Live a little...it's fun. Eh it’s Sunday morning last nights Whiskey is tearing apart my brain and the headline made it hurt even more. No the sentence reads ""Rock told no Smollett Jokes"" not ""Rock told 'No Smollett Jokes.'""  The title confused the heck out of me and most posters here because the way it's constructed makes no sense. The usage might be anachronistic but it is correct.😉 Would adding quotes be incorrect? I don't believe I ever said it would be. Bro it's a bad title.I thought you were saying he didn't tell any Smollet jokes but instead trashed him in a serious tone.Stop being a dick. Then shouldn’t you put it in quotes then? I don't write the headlines for that website. Oh shit headline then That appears to be your reading comprehension skills I think it took some balls to get up there and do this. I applaud Rock for calling out the bullshitter. I read the article mostly because the title confused me. r/titlegore I like the one white guy sitting there thinking ""I know everybody else is laughing but I feel like they would still judge me for laughing"" Trevor Noah is next to him losing his mind.

Foubar,They were waiting for the Midterms to be over No one bothers to mention this. All the coward R's who retired and a fake investigation that labeled the president a Russian agent fucked over the midterms.Now spineless Republicans celebrate Mueller finding nothing and pretend it was a legitimate investigation and never press further and say the entire investigation was bullshit and never should have happened. Had it been damning to Trump it would have come out in October to help the blue wave even more. Ding ding ding The fake investigation was to coverup hrc and bho. Damn is Comey really that tall? Yep! Mueller is 5' 11'' for comparison but Comey is like 6' 8'' I hate the investigation but I think the reason it took so long was because even if Mueller knew it was a farce he had to make sure and dot every i and cross every t. As to show how stupid it was and they could not say he just didn’t look. Go with top comment.  You are giving haters too much credit. That makes zero sense. He didn't find collusion because there was no collusion. The report being released would have exonerated Trump. And why would he say that with zero indictments and zero evidence? Trump has the ability to declassify and Congress has to be given access to proof during an impeachment. Not to mention the fact that Mueller would be in legal jeaoardy Trump could sue his has ass and Mueller would be subject to the discovery process. Again with zero evidence you can't just make shit up as a special councel Mueller works under the DoJ. Where have you been the last two years? Of course they can make shit up.Not a special councel.Mueller knew Trump was innocent long before the 2018 midterms and he didn’t say a word. It’s likely that cost Republicans seats.I know he did. Mueller is a corrupt piece of shit.The entire purpose of the special counsel was to remove Trump. They just didn’t count on him being as pure as he actually is.I agree. That doesn't mean that Mueller can just make shit up. That's why he had to nail Flynn and Popadopolis on process crimes. That's why he had to nail Manafort for FARA violations and punt Cohens tax evasion crimes to the Southern District  of New York.Mueller couldn't establish criminal conspiracy aka collusion not with Trump and not with any former members of his campaign. Mueller had to find process and tax crimes. That's all he had. If Mueller fabricated crimes implicating Trump he would have been investigated himself and would likely serve prison time or at the very least he would have been sued.Do you think Trump would have allowed a fabricated crime that goes far beyond fabricated narratives? Mueller served under the DOJ  he is subject to DOJ regulations and an AG that is not recused. Even the rat Rosenstein couldn't fabricate a crime that's why he had to expand the scope of the investigation for Mueller which is still classified.Mueller abused the legal process Democrats and the media made baseless accusation and ignored the truth. Fake News is still far removed from fake evidence planted by a DOJ appointed special councel. Trump had already established a legal team and forced McCabe and others to resign or step down. GOP swamp dwellers stood by and did nothing and prayed Mueller would find a crime.Impeachment isn't as simple as a vote. The president is entitled to demand all evidence against him Congress has the right to subpoena look through the evidence before they vote on impeachment. It's essentially a trial in front of Congress. Trump would have buried Mueller is he actually reported crimes in his report that never existed. Your point is wrong. You didn't even bother to read what I said. You can't fabricate collusion without the full weight of the DOJ and executive destroying your case and exposing the illegal not just the unethical corruption. Mueller made the process the punishment and desperately searched for a crime to implicate Trump. He didn't find one.If Dems won the Senate Muellers report would remain largely as it is now lacking collusion and lacking any crime implicating Trump. If Dems won the Senate Mueller would have dragged out the investion longer because he wouldn't have to fear GOP oversight and could have kept digging for crimes unrelated to collusion. A Dem congress would have built upon Muellers investigation and expanded it.But they couldn't establish collusion if they could just make it up they would have released it right before the midterms so they could win the Senate and hide the corruption. But even then Mueller serves under the DOJ and impeachment involves a congressional investigation similar to a court case. Even if Dems had Senate control they don't control the impeachment process. Trump would demand their proof Republicans would demand proof. Mueller would destroy his career and open himself up to prison or being  financially ruined by Trump and his legal team pre and post impeachment.,0,False,t3_b7u21m,15,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b7u21m/if_mueller_knew_early_on_that_trump_did_not/,51,,If Mueller Knew Early On That Trump Did Not Collude With Russia Why Did The Investigation Take So Long?,51,https://www.redstate.com/elizabeth-vaughn/2019/03/31/mueller-knew-early-trump-not-collude-russia-investigation-take-long/
covfefeMaster,"Because if that is true it destroys the Liberal narrative ""Because evil will always ex- wait a minute"" Where is the outrage for millions of aborted children.? Its okay to kill unarmed children but not in the process of our god given right to self defence? Hypocrisy at its best Her body her choice apparently. In a liberal's mind the mother is the victim and she supersedes the life of the unborn baby regardless of what stage of development it is in. I don't even know why I am posting this. The image is a low-effort regardless of whatever side you want to look at this from. In any case I wanted to see if this graphic was misleading and try and recreate the data I see from other studies. Most of what I see sourced are from the CDC which has stringent rules in misusing its data (fines revoking membership etc.) So it seems like a reasonable starting point. Additionally what I gather from reading is that the lines that get stretched are the interpretation of gun violence and incorporating children + teens in a single study.I often see teens and children lumped together. For example if you use studies like ""The Impact of Gun Violence of American Children and Teenagers"" (which many of its sources are via CDC's WISQARS Data Visualization) then you will notice the age ranges are 0-19. You can attempt to recreate the study with CDC's data. I was unsuccessful but here is the process I followed.Using that study and their visualization tool you can create a table that would look like:8295 Homicides Ages 0-19CategoryDeaths per 100kNumber of DeathsTotal1.988295Black7.65280American Indian Eskimo Aleut1.290White0.92816Asian Pacific Islander0.4109Male3.37033Female0.612620-4 Years Old0.32925-9 Years Old0.332110-14 Years Old0.555115-19 Years Old6.87131So if we said 0-14 with the idea of children and early teen then the number is 1164 deaths over 2013-2017 from homicide. I see gun violence including suicides so let's go down that route.5224 Suicides Ages 0-19CategoryDeaths per 100kNumber of DeathsTotal1.255224Black0.7472American Indian Eskimo Aleut1.6118White1.44503Asian Pacific Islander0.5131Male2.17033Female0.312620-4 Years Old0.005-9 Years Old0.0310-14 Years Old0.879515-19 Years Old4.24426At this point if we were to use the numbers from the CDC we would have an average of 9.28 deaths per day for children and teens.Now if we were to say ""All Intents Firearm deaths"" for ""Children and Teens (Age 0 to 19)"" you would see this table:14435 Deaths for All Intents Firearm Deaths Ages 0 - 19CategoryDeaths per 100kNumber of DeathsTotal3.4614435Unintentional0.1559Suicide1.35224Homicide2.08295Undetermined0.1228Legal Intervention0.0129Black8.96079American Indian Eskimo Aleut3.2241White2.576079Asian Pacific Islander1.0248Male5.912366Female1.020690-4 Years Old0.54525-9 Years Old0.440510-14 Years Old1.4147515-19 Years Old11.512103Alright this is far as I am going to take it. Based on the CDC studies there is no way this number is 13 children per day and I have no idea what the 1274/yr death rate is. The CDC reports there was 54053 deaths (10810/year) or for all injury deaths between the ages 0-19. The age group of 0-14 is 22539 deaths (4507/year). Finally age group 0-9 is 16757 deaths (3351/year). I guess this is all to say I wouldn't trust images with twitter handles as your references for either metric. It's all stupid. Just do your own research. I think that was the point of the meme/infographic. The Left likes to tout 13 kids per day but in reality as your data shows it is not even close. Looks like the info on the OP is sound. The age group of 0-14 is 22539 deaths (4507/year). Finally age group 0-9 is 16757 deaths (3351/year). I guess this is all to say I wouldn't trust images with twitter handles as your references for either metric.age group of 0-14 deaths: 4507/365 = 12.3age group of 0-9 deaths: 3351/465 = 9.18Unless I'm misinterpreting this data it seems pretty close to the statistic that OP is attempting to refute. If you sum up ages 0-14 (and assume that is the definition for children) then for suicide and homicide the number is ~1 death/day based on the CDC WISQARS data. The last paragraph relates to all intents of death and mechanisms of death. In the WISQARS you can filter based on these. If you leave it unfiltered then it means for all intents of death (unintentional violence suicide undetermined) and all mechanisms of death (adverse effects cut drowning falling fire/burn firearm non-firearm machinery natural overexertion etc etc.). With the unfiltered then you would have ~13 children per day killed. /u/justinvh it is hard to make a high-effort graphic that truly explains the issues. Look at your post- 5 paragraphs and 3 charts. Most people don't have the attention span for this kind of reading so short infographics have to suffice since most won't bother to do their own research. I don't understand. It seems like this is pretty close to 13: age group of 0-14 deaths: 4507/365 = 12.3.What am I misunderstanding? This is aggregated data for 2013-2017. Why did you mention ""The age group of 0-14 is 22539 deaths (4507/year)."". Is that a typo? No that's the 5 year count for all injury deaths. So 22539 / 5 = 4507. I was trying to understand where the number on the bottom of the meme was coming from but couldn't. There are other welfare studies that focus on abuse / neglect death but I didn't go dive into them. I'm just showing you can't compute the second number of the meme from the CDC data. so approximately 13 children are injured OR killed every day by guns? No if you use the WISQARS you will have a better understanding of what I am saying. There are intents of death and mechanisms of death. For all intents of death and all mechanisms of death (adverse effects cut drowning falling fire/burn firearm non-firearm machinery natural overexertion etc etc.) there were ~13 children per day killed. Broadening the scope of gun deaths to include adults (~1500 per year) the number of people who die each year from heart disease is around 840000+ per year.We don't have a gun problem- we have a mental health problem and this problem is overshadowed by fat-fucks-who-can't-put-down-a-Big-Mac problem.But this isn't sexy enough to talk about on the news since it involves a lot of personal responsibility- not smoking eating right exercising etc. It is much easier to prop up dead kids and demonize a gun.",0,False,t3_b7q6jf,19,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b7q6jf/gun_grabber_myths/,126,,Gun grabber myths,126,https://i.redd.it/to86gxb5ohp21.jpg

xFYD_,"They need him gone this is how. Because he polls better than all of them and he hasn’t even announced he’s running yet. This came from the democrats not the republicans the republicans would have waited until he won the primaries and was more of a threat so that it would have more of an impact but the dems need to beat him now and the best way to do that is if he can’t even run. In all fairness a recent CNN poll showing Biden leading didn't sample ANYONE under 50 years old. “Only Hillary can save us now!” - the DNC If Biden’s goes away then equal justice should be served. Kamala’s sex scandal should preclude her from running. Has any one in the media asked her how many blow jobs she gave to promote her career in California?? He needed to answer for this while he was vice president. I'm not disputing that he's a creep but it's curious that the Dems only care about this now. They do know he’s the best shot at beating Trump right? You have to wonder who’s behind this obvious ploy. It would be pure speculation to say Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris. But she's even more damaged considering how she got her positions in the Bay area. Joe Biden is a rapist infowars dot com. Give me a break. We knew he was like this before an allegation. They only care because an allegation was made. If they cared they would have confronted him on his creepy uncle vibe a long time ago. Creepy Joe before this had a super slim chance of winning. He's not charismatic like Obama if you've heard him speak he has the charisma of a wet blanket. His metoo moment puts the final nail in the coffin. ""Kavanaugh spiked my drink and raped me"" ""Trump grabbed my hand and started making out with me"" ""Biden kissed the back of my head and sniffed my hair""Sounds like she's been reading our maymays or it's real.

The public doesn't notice unless the media pushes it as an outrage and the media is going to studiously ignore this. There is no way the DNC is going to let a SWM be the top of the 2020 ticket. He doesn't need to answer to any allegations.  The burden of proof is on the accuser either engage the legal system or piss off.  This need to have the witch repent in public is getting tired.

I hate “diversity” why not just pick the most qualified candidate regardless of skin color? It’s so racist. But liberals are racists thats a known fact. They dont care about progress they only want to look hip and cool in the eyes of other degenerates. Because some people honestly believe a black person has no chance at competing with white people so diversity quotas to ensure a safe space where they don’t have to compete. The people against racism are the only ones keeping it alive This shit pisses me off. Blacks used to be discriminated against and harmed all the time and no one was held accountable cause nobody cared. Is this not the same yet on a smaller scale? The only people who cared were Republicans and now the only ones that care are the Republicans. What’s changed?

mtgheron,Because Republicans aren't obsessed with identity and race. Is that really in a text book? Yup.  It's really prevalent.  My (high school) daughter informed me that the civil war occurred solely for the freeing of the slaves and that no other contributing factors were ever discussed in history class Yep. It's in my college textbook for American Government. What's the point of the question? I'm not sure. I can only imagine that it's to point out that to some people religion matters more than race. It's just hard to tell if they think that's a good thing or a bag thing. Real question: If this was in my textbook I’d be like wtf but what could you do about it? Fortunately my professor wrote the book (most used American Government textbook in college government courses). In this case I do have the opportunity to confront the author. O wow.

chabanais,"I don't think it's a good idea to split up one of the few subs where conservatives are welcomed. Plus this means there's officialy no forum for regular discussion. I didn't join r/Conservative for just maymays or just articles from other websites. Exactly. This subreddit is 200k strong and it's the only stronghold we have. This should be reversed. If memes want to be made then there should be a subreddit created for that. Not the other way around. This should remain the subreddit for discussion as anyone who comes here simply by searching ""conservative"" can hopefully come across decent discussion and have their mind changed. No one will think or care to look up ConservativeArticles.People migrate towards ""funny stuff"" easier than serious things. It would be easier to start a meme subreddit.Edit: I do see how memes are definitely easier to understand however. Sometimes it's just simpler to see a funny picture and be like ""holy crap that makes a good point actually..."" (assuming you aren't on the right). Trump didn't win with articles or diatribes or whateva. He won because of memes from 4chan and r/the_donald . It's high time this sub embraced the fact that memetic warfare is the future. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't post articles... even TD has non-meme posts. I've even seen good discussion on TD from time to time.  It's rare but it happens.This should be a place for memes discussion and articles.  Why are the mods addressing a problem that doesn't exist?  I liked it as it was. A bunch of people complained I guess so they created a problem. I beg the mods to restore the old format.Edit: on second thought I might just be an Idiot and I'll wait until tomorrow to find out. One day the Geneva Convention will cover Memetic Warfare. Until then....... Memes are the way forward and the way that we'll win this culture war. Embrace the change. Memes are a lot more effective than serious conversations. Memes are the future. Conservative-adjective 1. holding to traditional attitudes and values and cautious about change or innovation typically in relation to politics or religion.noun 1. a person who is averse to change and holds to traditional values and attitudes typically in relation to politics. Am I going crazy or have the mods? This almost feels like a hostile takeover of the mods accounts and someone is trying to tank the sub.Edit:  Think about today’s date. https://i.imgur.com/rFjMfcn.jpg I just didn't join this place for memes. I joined for news and discussion. Now that's gone. And now I realize how late in the night this happened. Gross prepare for quality to go down. A sub of 200000 doesnt need to be split into 2. I dont like this mods. I'm just gonna assume this whole thing is an April Fools joke until further notice. No way they just nuked their own sub Reddit and all turned into teenage memers who openly praise the Donald. Just look at the automod. It’s worth it.The power of memes will elevate the conservative cause. Nah dude watch this sub just become a shit parody of the donald. And with most memes it’s just a straw man argument too.   If anything we should make a separate sub for the memes. The front page is basically just memes now. Unsub.Why not just go to r/the_donald ?Edit: also I'm re reading the original thread where this question was asked. The overwhelming consensus was that this sub should not be just memes.Edit: damnit.

The counties surrounding DC are the richest in the country m. So it is very much like Hunger Games. Not hard to understand unless you’re an entrenched Leftist who simply wants to amend the Constitution to suit your ambition. Amend it? They want to do away with it altogether as it is a hinderance in their pursuit of never ending all encompassing power. It's probably easier to point out what they don't want to radically change the constitution I know people here hate snopes but you shouldn’t need to misconstrue the stats to make your point: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-clinton-counties-won/He still won far more counties. Came here for the tea numbers- knew this post was exaggerated. Thanks. This is ridiculously and blatantly false. Clinton did not win only 57 counties. It’s closer to 500.  Many states don’t have counties (parishes districts etc) but including those the tally is somewhere around 2600 Trump and 500 Clinton.I’m a huge proponent of the Electoral College but spreading outright made up statistics is ridiculous and makes Conservatives look bad. I thought the 57 seemed low based on maps I saw of voting results by county. Thank you! This stupid thing is perpetuated all over Facebook and it’s almost entirely inaccurate. Do research before you post or share. It makes you look bad.The electoral college is important but use real facts and logic no need to exaggerate. I'm in favor of the electoral college but this is a terrible argument. Why should my vote count for less just because I live in a city?The best argument is that the US is made up of 50 sovereign states each with their own separate interests. The US is a federation of states. When that federation was created the small states demanded an equal say to the big states in the senate and extra elecoral college votes to make sure they couldn't be pushed around by the large states.That's the purpose of the electoral college and the Senate to prevent a few large states from pushing around the small states. Good point and it was the first one that came to my mind as well.   I always think back to the ""Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch"" when this sort of thing comes up.   We always need to keep the majority from pushing around the little guy.   The problem comes when I try to get my head around who the little guy is who the big guy is etc.   Is the big guy the majority of individuals in the country who voted Hillary for President?  Maybe it is then the EC did it's job.   But maybe the little guy is the people living in densely populated areas we need to ensure their vote is equivalent to the vote of someone in rural Kansas where each vote carries a bigger piece of the pie.   Idk I've gotten myself lost again trying to decide who we need the EC to help (over a direct democracy) ie who is the sheep. Frankly I don't care that much. It's important to have democratic elements combined with ways of limiting and spreading around government power. The electoral college and the Senate are plenty democratic. Getting rid of them would massively help the Democrats gain power to institute socialism. Throughout our history one party or another benefited from them. The only new thing is all the complaining since Democrats lost the electoral college despite winning the popular vote twice over the last 20 years.I'm pretty pessimistic over the long run with Millennials being so Leftist. Without the electoral college and Senate we'd be screwed. I wouldn't be surprised if Democrats dominated the House for decades with short periods of Republican control when the public wants to send a message similar to 1932-1994.btw it makes zero sense to argue against the electoral college but not the Senate. The electoral college is extremely close to pure democracy. The Senate is not even close with Wyoming and California getting the same number of Senators. ""The electoral college and the Senate are plenty democratic.""""btw it makes zero sense to argue against the electoral college but not the Senate.""The EC distribution of power more closely matches the HoR than the Senate.  (435 (HoR) + 100 (SEN) = 535 (EC) or 81.3% HoR vs 18% SEN).

xFYD_,"'Bout fucking time. Righteous! Good trump Now move on to the aid for countries in the Middle East and Africa. Even for things like humanitarian aid why are we separately giving aid if we already donate so much to international organizations? End it all. Probably to counter Chinese expansionism. China keeps giving out huge loans that it knows these African countries can’t pay back. Then they just take over facilities for defaulting on payment. Shit that's right out of Confessions of an Economic Hitman That's incredibly stupid though.""Hey guys how do we prevent China from giving them a bunch of money?""""I know let's give them money as well. Surely if they get money from us they will stop taking money from China!""Supposedly there's some mechanisms to prevent that but it's easy to see that a lot of our aid recipients are also taking Chinese loans. Cut ALL the foreign aid. This country is over 20 trillion dollars in debt. We can't afford to hand money to another country! While in a perfect world this would be my belief due to the nature of reality I believe we should give some form of foreign aid to nations either begging for help or who have actively made concessions otherwise America is seen as hostile using only the stick and never the carrot. Of course the form of aid should be tailored to said nation weather it be monetary economic or sociopolitical. Most and I mean most of the time it ends up being controlled by war lords and corrupt politicians police and other officials.  Remember the VZ aid that got set on fire? I see your connection to them thinking we are helping them but most of them hate us. We’ve been predominantly using the carrot since we got involved in world affairs in the first place over 100 years ago. Why do we care at all how struggling countries who have nothing for us perceive our foreign policy? Maybe it’s time we go back to the stick. Bring back the Contras! Let's see how many RINOs in Congress bail from supporting him on this. Good. Why is the U.S giving aid to any foreign country? We should cut all aid and focus on the U.S Good.  They never deserved our tax dollars in the first place.  What good have those nations ever brought the world? Good. Actions have consequences. You allow an invasion to head our way we cut your aid. I realize this is an unpopular opinion but this may make the issue worse not better. In theory foreign aid goes towards improving structural conditions which makes illegal immigration far less desirable.Depending on how corrupt governments are that may happen or it may just go into their pockets. No he wants to cut aid. He doesn't have the power to cut aid without congress' approval.

Aodhan88,"Just remember “anti-lgbtq” is code for “Christian beliefs about sexuality and marriage”. So if you espouse Christian beliefs you are branded as “hateful”. If a grown adult wants to seek out conversion therapy for themselves who am I to judge?There’s all kinds of bullshit on the shelves at my local drug chain that claim this and claim that. Why is conversion therapy singled out? (Rhetorical question).Restrict it for minors if it’s that bad. Yeah I have no problem with an adult doing so. No.  It wasn’t even the company but the founder coming out in support of traditional marriages and donating to organizations like focus on the family and the family research council that advocated for traditional marriage.   Nothing to do with so called “conversion therapy”. What rights are restricted by a Christian organization espousing this viewpoint? How are they restricting anyone’s rights? Or are you just gonna make another lame attempt at equating Christianity with Islam? Again you dodged the question of “how are they restricting anyone’s rights”? They aren’t the government and have no power to do such a thing. And homosexuals have the same “protections” as straight people. You can’t kill a homosexual. You can’t rob a homosexual. You can’t assault kidnap etc. someone because they’re gay. It’s all illegal.Want to have a gay wedding in a church? Find one who will do it. Otherwise you’re the one persecuting someone because of what they believe. No one is “denying you a right” because there is no right to use someone else’s facility or services. You don’t have the “right” to force someone to do business with you. Just the same as a business can restrict guns from their premises that isn’t a violation of your right to bear arms. You still have that right and you can take your business elsewhere.(And before you claim “a gun isn’t the same as a person” you’re right. Owning and brandishing a gun is an action. So is a gay wedding or a sexual act. It’s the act that is forbidden not the person.)Also just because a god condemns an act across multiple religions (oh and non-Abrahamic religions do as well) that still doesn’t equate the two. If it restricts the rights of Americans based on religion then yeah that's some Sharia shit right there.Might want to update that flair Ayatollah.This was your original comment to which I posed the question “how are they restricting” said rights?And again what rights are they “wanting” to restrict? I’ve pointed out they don’t have the “right” to someone else’s goods or services. Now what? Case in point: look at all those homosexuals stoned by churches in the past decade alone So you can take your absurd hatred of Christ-Followers to just about any other subreddit and you decide that r/conservative is a good place for it.

Activists driven by their own personal grievances then launched a crusade to find the phantom suspects doxing and targeting innocent people in the process.""This right here is the fucking problem.  Culture that is so god damned obsessed with outrage rhetoric and the need for victimhood.  When the crimes aren't there to justify your world view just make them up and claim your victim credit.  And if you are called out on your bullshit default to the 'I raised awareness of the issue' excuse.  This shit sickens me to no end. The amount of people that are just assaulting gay people < the amount of gay people willing to lie about being assaultedIt isn't even close btw That’s because they all want their 15 minutes on Ellen to get her sympathy.  Forget that they don’t do anything to actually earn the accolades.  We have a game culture on the left where they all want to be superstars and popular.  They turn to YouTube/twitch cause they can’t do anything in real life to be successful.  They think their sparkling personality will resonate with hundreds of thousands.  They get emotionally destroyed when no one watches so they turn to their next card victimhood.  Until they realize fame is not the most important thing in the world this is what we will have. If this was happening in the Midwest there is a slight chance I would believe it but in Portland come on. They are all leftie loonies. This is our new reality: one side accuses the other of something. When the other side isn’t actually doing it they then fake such hateful actions to provoke outrage at the other side.It’s an old tactic that still works: agents provocateurs. Only a matter of time until they fake just the right person in just the right place to cause the right amount of blowback that erupts into the civil war they appear to seek. Remember when Occupy Wall Street claimed that so much? I remember. Wheeler and the police bend over backward (and frontward) for the gay community in Portland.  This is a bunch of ""activists"" trying to work the community up into a frenzy to obtain sympathy and get the policies they want which are authoritarian gob-lee gook.The sad thing is that this will probably be effective in Portland which will continue to spiral down into a leftist shit show of utter stupidity.   The drug problem and resulting homelessness in both Portland and Seattle are 10x worse that what they used to be just 10 years ago.  At this rate Portland and Seattle will denigrate into sewers (literally). Target the perpetrators.Of the hoaxes. Well when you import people from cultures that hate gay people you're going to get more ""hate crimes"".

xFYD_,"She'll be banned from Twitter in 3....2.....1..... If sports ban people who who use steroids (artificial hormones that affect performance) then they should also have a policy on people with sex changes (also artificial hormones that affect performance). The rebuttal from that male-to-female cyclist is amazingly bad.  Just completely avoids the issue.Paula continues to ignore facts: trans women are legally female [and] trans women have been permitted to compete in Olympic-eligible sports since October 2003.""The very idea that we must ""protect"" cis women’s – or ""female"" – sport from trans women who are legally female too is an irrational fear of trans women which is the dictionary definition of transphobia.Nobody is arguing about the legal status of trans people.  The argument is that you're physically different from actual women because you are male.  I also hate when they call people cis-anything.  They're not cis-women they're women.  They don't need to add some made up bullshit term because of your gender issues.What really surprises me about all this is how these trans athletes just completely lack any respect or humility.  Not only are they using their physical advantages to beat women but on top of that they're obnoxious about it! And why not?  The whole premise is ridiculous.  Why not exploit it just to show how bad of an idea it really is?  The irony of it is that feminists are both the proponents and victims of it.Then again female only sports underline the division between the sexes.  Perhaps feminists really do want this and the cost is destroying female sports and robbing girls of a valuable activity.Perhaps what feminists want is for schools to only have one genderless team per sport.  Naturally men would be recruited instead of women due to their being stronger and faster.  But that won't fit Leftist ideology.  They'll demand women be recruited too.  So they'll then recruit trans women.  That won't be enough for them.  They'll demand non trans women be recruited too and that everyone gets to play an equal amount.  Men will demolish them so Leftists will demand we no longer keep score.  Then the aliens monitoring us from Venus will lose hope in humanity and will bombard us with nukes putting us out of our misery. What's the feminist solution to this? One team for both genders but quotas so 50% are women. Equal opportunities! Yeah. I remember that story about that British Rapper who identifies as a woman temporarily to beat a deadlift record and switches back to male. Not even close to fair. I know many on the left say that it is impracticle to have separate divisions for transgender athletes but it honestly seems to me to be the best solution. Especially considering top-tier athletes are coming out against MTF athletes competing in women's sports. They should just compete in the men's division much simpler that way.The main reason sports have a ""women's division"" is to protect women from competitors they can't compete against (men or MTF). The ""men's division"" on the other hand doesn't exist to protect anybody from anything. Why should they get a special snowflake division? They’re MEN trying to compete against women. They should be competing in the men’s division. Or just not compete at all. We should not be sending over backwards to accommodate this fringe group at every turn. Want to complete? Accept what you actually are. Seriously.We are going to have an entire division just for the 0.0000002% of the population that are trans people competing at a high level? We should separate sports by biological sex not whatever the left has decided gender means.I don’t care if you feel like a woman and want to act like one you compete in men’s sports. God bless her. SO BRAVE Transexuals need psychiatric help not medals. Still blows my mind that this is even a conversation. It's 100% science that being born a male gives you an insane advantage physically even if you take drugs and chop stuff off later. In sports this should be the end of conversation.

Horace_Mump,Why would a Muslim leader ask for an apology over what happened over 500 years ago? That's easy folks. He's psychologically preparing Spanish society for a reversal of the reconquista.

Clatsop,"Top Tards American Revolution for sure. I feel like people always discount that generation of Americans. My family has been in the US since the early 1700's and many of them fought in the revolution as well as 1812. Essentially wrestled away this colony from an Empire and built the country. I have a musket in my office that was handed down to me by my grandfather that once belonged to someone in the late 1700's in our family was most likely used in the wars.Hearing people say ""wyhppl is prvlage""  and I'm a ""Mexican-American etc-American"" really annoys me. I'm not ""English-American"" I'm American by ethnicity and so are you. Are we on the same team or not? Teddy Roosevelt 1915“There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism…German-Americans Irish-Americans English-Americans French-Americans Scandinavian-Americans or Italian-Americans. There is no such thing as a hyphenated American who is a good American. The only man who is a good American is the man who is an American and nothing else.” From John Wayne's 1973 album America Why I love Her! ""We are Americans. That says it all.""Thank you for this link I had not heard it before. Love The Duke! I agree with you but I still like to call myself Middle Eastern-American. It’s hard to explain. A little backstory: I’m white. I’m half European (British Irish German French) and half Middle Eastern (Iranian and Armenian). My mom’s family (European) is just like your family we’ve been here for a LONG time. My dad’s family (Middle Eastern) hasn’t been here very long. My father is a first-generation American. He was bullied and treated like shit during the Iranian Hostage Crisis. The reason I don’t call myself British-American or German-American but like to say Iranian-American or Armenian-American is because I’ve never been picked on for being British or German or whatever but have been called a “FUCKING TERRORIST” and “FUCKING MUSLIM” a billion times. It’s hard to explain but it’s more of a pride thing. I’m Middle Eastern AND I’m American. I remember when I was in first grade and some other kids found out I was Middle Eastern and they started shouting that I was “ FOREIGN” and not American. Do you see what I mean?I have an interesting ability to be able to see both sides of the coin. Since I blend in with white people (I mean really white people like Europeans) and everybody assumes I’m Italian or Jewish I know what it’s like to be called a “RACIST TRUMP SUPPORTER” and be called our for having “WHITE PRIVILEGE”. But on the other hand when people learn I’m half Middle Eastern they completely change their tune. I’m now an Uncle Tom for my kind.Really at the end of the day race/ethnicity is bullshit. I wish we all could just put it behind us and love each other for who we are but that’s never gonna happen ;(God bless America 🇺🇸. God bless white black Asian Latino Middle Eastern and Native Americans 😊.EDIT: The guy who just replied to me below saying I’m “seeking attention” is a prime example of what is wrong with our society. Did he even bother to read my comment? Why does he have to be so insulting? The reason I’m not replying to him directly is because I want to rise above and not stoop to his level... I’ve been in way too many Reddit arguments. I wish we all could just put it behind us and love each other for who we are but that’s never gonna happen ;(One easy way to put it behind us is to stop hyphenating everything. Somewhere I saw Morgan Freeman asked about how to improve race relations. He replied ""stop talking about it.""EDIT:  Found it here:  https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/michael-w-chapman/flashback-morgan-freeman-ending-racism-stop-talking-about-itWallace:  “How are we going to get rid of racism and ….”Freeman:  “Stop talking about it. I'm going to stop calling you a white man and I'm going to ask you to stop calling me a black man. I know you as Mike Wallace. You know me as Morgan Freeman."" According to most federal employment applications Middle East is considered ""White"". We are in a culture where identifying as something else besides an American is special.You were born here in the states why can't you just identify as American? Because you like to be different and add I am bla bla American. For attention maybe probably.A month ago I was listening to a conversation in the office on this very topic. A young black women surprisingly stated that she is not 'African American black American she is a American and putting titles with your skin color is BS'. Yes I was very surprised maybe she meant it maybe she said it because of the racist that we work with thinks his darker skin color makes him a better person or may I say a special person who is owed everything that this life could ever offer anyone.If you have to have a title in front of 'American' to state your nationality remember everyone on this world is a part of something or a little bit of every nationality there is. So bla bla American is not special. If you can't just say your American your looking for attention any type of attention. And he chooses the victim title for extra points... According to most federal employment applications Middle East is considered ""White"". I have a musket in my office that was handed down to me by my grandfather that once belonged to someone in the late 1700's in our family was most likely used in the wars.Amazing that's so neat. America is a melting pot. A lot of us come from ""foreign"" heritages in addition to our American one. Hence Mexican-Americans Eh the idea is you leave behind your old identity to become American.  Hence there are no ""Mexican-Americans"" there are only ""Americans.""That's what ""melting pot"" means. That's what ""melting pot"" means.It's kind of sad that this has to be explained to people nowadays. It used to be basic shit and I remember it being explained in elementary school back in the '90s.But now there's people like the person you responded to who are un-ironically using that phrase and pretending it means literally the exact opposite of its actual meaning.

ReaganTroll,The judge made his decision; now let him enforce it. Totally okay with this. There's times we just need to let nature be this is one of those times. A federal judge in Alaska has reinstated a ban on oil-and-gas drilling in vast swaths of the Arctic Ocean potentially undermining a central part of the Trump administration’s effort to expand offshore drilling.Mr. Trump will need congressional authority according to the ruling to reopen drilling in Arctic areas and smaller parts of the Atlantic Ocean that the Obama administration put off limits just weeks before President Obama left office. The late Friday ruling invalidates an executive order Mr. Trump issued during his first months in office aimed to overturning the ban.There is no ongoing commercial drilling in those areas and the Alaskan oil industry has been hampered by low oil prices for years limiting the immediate effects from the ruling. But it does raise questions about a long-awaited overhaul of the country’s offshore drilling plan the Trump administration was expected to issue in the coming weeks.The Trump administration had proposed opening offshore areas around the country including almost all of offshore Alaska. Though the draft proposal faced stiff opposition from several coastal states and environmental groups an Arctic expansion had wide support from Alaskan leaders hoping for a revival and an oil industry interested in expanding its options.“This is a great victory for the Arctic its polar bears other wildlife and communities. It’s absolutely the right outcome under the law and for the sake of our planet” said Kristen Monsell a senior attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit challenging the Trump administration.A spokeswoman for the Interior Department said the department doesn’t comment on ongoing litigation.“From a long-term perspective it is a central area when it comes to our energy policy and future energy production” said Erik Milito of the American Petroleum Institute the oil-and-gas industry trade association that was a party to the case.Friday’s ruling focuses on about 125 million acres of the U.S. Arctic Ocean and 3.8 million acres of the Atlantic Ocean the latter focused on offshore areas from Maryland to Massachusetts. The decision to block drilling there came as part of a wave of last-minute environmental actions from Mr. Obama to “preserve a healthy Arctic ecosystem and protect our fragile Arctic waters” Mr. Obama said at the time.Mr. Trump issued an order in 2017 to overturn Mr. Obama’s action part of his agenda to boost domestic energy production. But legal experts and analysts had warned that he may not have the power to overturn the ban under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.U.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason agreed. That 1953 law includes a sentence saying the president may “from time to time withdraw” from consideration any currently unleased lands in federal offshore waters. It has been invoked only a handful of times and doesn’t include a procedure for a new president to undo actions by a predecessor.Judge Gleason ruled that Congress had passed other laws that clearly authorized a president to revoke the decisions of a predecessor. This law had not she said concluding Mr. Trump didn’t have that authority.The decision could face appeal. If it isn’t overturned it would require Congress to act to open up many offshore areas the Trump administration had included as part of its expansion. That appears unlikely at a time when Democrats have control of the House and have prioritized climate-change policies to limit fossil-fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

guanaco55,Fact: 75% of New Yorkers will continue to vote for pro-abortion politicians. The Religion trumps minor quibbles about the lives of children.  :) damn.  a little breakdown of numbers here:34% pro life 62% pro choicebut still 75% against abortion after 20 weeks.  this gives me a lot of hope that democrats are starting to see the ugly side of their party and we may be moving in the right direction in regards to abortion. In 100 years we'll look back on abortion the way we look back on slavery now. god i hope you're right Much more likely we'll look abortion the same way we look at gas lamps an antiquated solution to an antiquated problem. Birth control of the future will likely be so improved that abortion will vanish as an issue. Slavery was/is antiquated. We still look back on it as a stain on our nation. Prochoice is a partisan label. As in if you are a Democrat you will state you are prochoice even if you hold a prolife position.Gallup yearly polling shows this divergence. 20 weeks is extremely late and I think most of the country would agree with banning abortions past this time. Nice Seeing pictures of the baby/fetus at 12 weeks should be enough to make a person stop and think about what they're doing much less doing it at 20 weeks. Bear in mind this is a phone poll of ny state with 981 responders.  I dont know how the samplecsize compares to other polls but this is not persuasive to me at least. 981 is a huge sample size for a state poll. A poll with a sample size of 1000 can predict a presidential election within 3%. Just curious is phone poll the best collecting method? Or does that skew the data favoring certain demographics over others? Truly curious. Phone polls are definitely screwy. Perhaps they have a method of adjusting for that but idk. I just wanted to clarify that the sample size itself wasn't such a big issue other factors still could be. Sample size is meaningless if random sampling isn't a factor At least NY is somewhat salvageable unlike California.,0,False,t3_b7gvpg,20,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b7gvpg/poll_75_percent_of_new_yorkers_would_ban_abortion/,273,,Poll: 75 Percent of New Yorkers Would Ban Abortion After 20 Weeks,273,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/03/30/poll-75-percent-of-new-yorkers-would-ban-abortion-after-20-weeks/

Fox News and Fox Tv are still separate entities. I guess I misunderstood the wording. I read the press releases as the Fox company formed a new parent company called Fox Corporation which Disney now owned. Woopsie Pretty sure Fox became owned by an independent entity after the buyout.

MediaMember,It is absolute BULLSHIT... WOMEN have A RIGHT to Compete against ACTUAL WOMEN. And...... Now she's a sexist transphobe. Watch her get slandered by the left now. God forbid a woman who actually knows about the topic come out and state a fact. The women who compete are the absolute best source for whether or not it's fair. Biological men are biological men and have an advantage against biological women. Anyone who disagrees is just an idiot. I hope the left loses its shit. The vast majority of people I interact with aren't far left or far right. The left will lose the middle if they stomp their feet about moonbat issues like this. You're going to have a hell of a time one convincing moderates that this is an important issue while healthcare can be astronomically expensive in a country $20 trillion+ in debt and two that biologically male athletes should be allowed to dominate female sports.

Clatsop,"Well shit. Here comes a wave of fucking gun seizures sparked by busy body soccer moms and spiteful Ex-whatevers. Already seeing the results in [Maryland] (https://patch.com/maryland/glenburnie/officer-serving-protective-order-fatally-shoots-armed-man) and [New Zealand] (https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12216949) The left hates due process. a bill that would create the legal framework for judges to order the removal of firearms from people they determine to be at risk of harming themselves or others.Doesn't sound like an  inherently bad thing. But I do see how it arguably could be abused through arbitrary enforcements. it's arbitrarily bad because as the ""victim"" of this bill your first interaction is when the police show up in force to raid your house and remove your weapons.you have no representation and the burden of proof is on You to prove that you're not a danger.Even if you DO prove you're not a danger the bill allows a judge to decide you are.Then it's all a civil proceeding the state is not required to provide you with legal representation. So even if you decide to fight through the very narrow challenge process? You have to pay for it out of pocket.This is an absolute garbage bill and a horrific affront on personal liberties. So rich people get to keep their guns. Feature not bug. This you?https://m.imgur.com/a/5FTLq https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a427rx/anyone_still_waiting_on_university_of_minnesotaChecks out.

Be that as it may I don't see why my age always negates my views. live and learn I guess.also obligatory stereotypical older military gun-toting redneck meme that's overused Ha true enough. Best of luck to you. Grats on the acceptance! Your perspective here seems well off. to me.You're saying this person is an immediate danger and requires disarming by force of law without due process.But that we only need to send two officers to nicely ask. Despite the person being a danger / threat to themselves and the people around them. We don't need to arrest them or inpatient them. Just use a civil case to strip a constitutional right from them without notifying them or allowing them to defend themselves.And it's OK for the government to have this power. because they can be trusted to never abuse or misuse it.That's what i'm hearing is that what you're saying? In the constitution the safety of the people or “common defense” triumphs over the right to bear arms. It should be common practice that dangers to society as decreed by a judge should not have a device that can end a life with a click of a button. There’s already legislature that prevents sexual assaulters and other types of convicts from buying weaponry this should be considered a simple corollary. I think you are under the false assumption that the government can strip you of your guns at a whim based arbitrarily where in fact just like any other civil case of law it passes through a court and you have the right to appeal. The burden of proof is still largely on the court as they must prove YOU a danger rather than you having to prove that you are not a danger. The phrasing in the article is rather misleading. I don't get the opportunity to defend myself. i'm convicted without knowing a trial happened.only after the trial only after the evidence against me has been accepted at face value with nobody speaking against it. only after my property has been taken from me and my privacy and home has been invaded. only then may i Pay to petition the court to hear about my innocence.This bill is the worst sort of garbage. You do get a chance to defend yourself. The article is misleading. I read the actual bill. First a person files an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) with the court at risk of perjury. Next within seven days a hearing is held where the burden of proof is on the accuser. The court then determines the next actions. The police must get a warrant and take the guns peacefully. If an ERPO is placed you are only restricted for 182 days in which you can appeal at any time. here’s the bill. Its not that extreme. you do get a chance to defend yourselfAfter they've taken your arms and ammunition",0,False,t3_b7kusj,20,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b7kusj/colorado_senate_passes_red_flag_bill/,24,,Colorado Senate Passes Red Flag Bill,24,https://bearingarms.com/tom-k/2019/03/29/colorado-senate-passes-red-flag-bill/
thatrightwinger,"Biden isn't a good candidate. Hopefully he is the nominee. Serious question though: Has anyone ever uttered any policy-based reason to vote for him?I hope he runs just to watch Democrats scramble over to Google to find an excuse to push that handsy prick. Yea I wonder if Biden would actively pursue big changes I definitely wouldn’t be mad if he didn’t. I think it would actually benefit the country if a president (dem or republican) didn’t for a couple years and let the country rest and expose congressmen for being lazy. Biden is a do nothing kind of guy. That is what made him a great VP. I disagree.  He by far polls the best against Trump in Battle ground States especially in the upper Midwest where there are a lot of blue color whites.  I don't see Trump beating him honestly.  They would be stupid not to nominate him. Ahh polls. He polls high because people know his name that's it. He is an old white guy that isn't going to inspire the Dems new base. Well duh Orange Man Bad and Joe can beat him! I don’t think this is accurate. I read about the story on CNN. They are referring to on TV. Typically when a high profile political figure is accused of sexual misconduct it gets reported on the news on TV. It's relatively big news compared to the constant complaining about Trump that airs 24/7 on CNN. God forbid they objectively report the news though. They'd rather pick and choose what the people deserve to hear about. Instead they can write a half assed article and not promote it and be able to say they ""reported on it."" Might be talking TV. I didn’t read the article either. Surprising?  They want him on the 2020 ticket with Obama as VP. That can't happen. It would give Obama the potential to have more than 2 terms which violates one of the amendments (26 I think) 25th deals with presidential succession.Given the language (like the debate around birthright citizenship regarding the 14th) there’s probably a case to be made that a person ineligible to take the presidency may be able to be VP and would just be left out of the line of succession. No one’s ever pushed it so we haven’t gotten a SCOTUS ruling to clarify whether a VP must be in the line of succession but lower spots (like cabinet positions) have historically been left out based on ineligible people holding the office. https://www.redstate.com/elizabeth-vaughn/2019/03/30/best-joe-biden-7-creepy-moments/",0,False,t3_b7hnqf,15,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b7hnqf/cnn_msnbc_ignore_explosive_misconduct_allegation/,89,,CNN MSNBC ignore explosive misconduct allegation against Biden,89,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cnn-msnbc-ignore-explosive-misconduct-allegation-against-biden

Well he’s either going to apologize in a day or end up on Webb/Chaffee island with Delaney The company gave $1.8 million to anti-LGBTQ groups in 2017 according to its most recent tax filings.Yeah what?Via ThinkProgress:For example the Chick-fil-A Foundation gave more than $1 million in 2015 (nearly one-sixth of its total grants) to the the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.The horror!The religious organization which seeks to utilize athletes and coaches to spread Christian teachings imparts a strongly anti-LGBTQ message.The link in this paragraph takes you to the FCA playbook . No mention of homosexuality lgbtq gay or any other keyword. It simply defines how they see marriage and sexual activity as between one man and one woman. They must hate Mormons by this definition but I’m sure ThinkProgress isn’t concerned with that or won’t try to spin it that way.Staff and volunteers with the organization have been required to adhere to a strict “sexual purity” policy prohibiting any “homosexual acts” even for married couples.Well duh? They are a Christian organization teaching Christian morals. Those include sexual purity. The link here takes you to fca Austin’s document  which reads:FCA’s Sexual Purity Statement God desires His children to lead pure lives of holiness. The Bible is clear in teaching on sexual sin including sex outside of marriage and homosexual acts. Neither heterosexual sex outside of marriage nor any homosexual act constitute an alternative lifestyle acceptable to God.Pure hatred right? I mean this is literally calling for the stoning of gays in the streets isn’t it?No. It’s saying “You want to be part of our private organization you abide by our rules.” That’s it. No hate. No violence. Not even close to the leftist bullshit they are pushing simply because Chick-Fil-A is founded on Christian principles.And that is all this is folks. If the left wants to win they know they have to dismantle every traditional facet of society. Anything hat harkens back to a time before must be destroyed. That includes marriage family and especially religion. Your god must be the state and no other. And the lgbtqaip+&@ agenda is their linchpin argument. They are losing the abortion fight so this is where they put their stock.Anything that holds to traditional marriage is deemed “hateful” and “harmful” to society. Anything that teaches sexual purity or even disagrees with homosexuality is “violence” to gays. Never mind that Christianity teaches “love your neighbor as yourself” and “let he who is without sin cast the first stone”. Well that's the end of his campaign.

Google is really becoming a problem. Once they start big time manipulation then they need to be broken up. I don’t want regulations I want google pulled apart because they are interfering with the individual’s personal choice. Seriously their offenses are infinitely worse than Microsoft yet Microsoft was taken to court on monopoly charges. The difference is Microsoft at that that time didn't have a large lobbyist and political arm yet Google does. So we haven't heard a peep about breaking them up. The second they misstep with the left and they will that will change on a dime Doesn't Fauxcahontas want to break them up? I'm guessing that she didn't like something that they did to her. Yes but Warren doesn’t have that loyal protection of the left. She’s made too many gaffs and her time is limited. The left would help destroy her for less than Klondike bar. The problem with the monopoly argument is that Google isn't a monopoly. A monopoly is when there is only one provider of a product/service accessible. There are other search engines available there are many browsers other then Chrome that you can download. In terms of smartphones/tablets they are close to a monopoly as Apple phones with their OS is the only major alternative to Android. They're much closer to a monopoly than Microsoft ever was and Microsoft ended up losing. The fact that you can't delete default apps makes competition significantly harder I for one can't download an alternative browser because Chrome takes up too much storage. Are you talking about Android? What kind of device do you have that doesn't have enough hard drive space to add a new browser?Google is closer to a monopoly in the phone/tablet market as Apple is the only real alternative operating system and on many phones you can't change the operating system (I believe some people have discovered ways around this for certain phones/android versions but it is difficult). They dominate market share for searches. They also own YouTube which has no competition and regularly censor conservatives.So yes a monopoly argument could be made to break them up. They have Democrats paid off so it is unlikely to happen. They dominate the market by people's choice though. I don't think that fits the legal definition of monopoly but I'm not a legal expert. Microsoft was dominate due to people's choice. A monopoly is when there is effectively no competition for a good or service. Is this not interfering in foreign elections (if they were doing this before he was elected which they surely were) much more than Russia's Facebook ads? /r/degoogle ""I was a libertarian until Google"" —Tucker Carlson. I'm no fan of regulation but Google search engine results is like info from the public library. Most everyone uses it and it seems unfair to filter searches like it would be unfair for the library to hide certain books. I think a better argument is platform vs publisher or perhaps one about what they claim to provide.

They should lose their press passes at the very least. Not only did they perpetuate fake news but the Washington Post itself has light over eight thousand times since Trump's electionThey have a running list of supposed Trump lies. The total is 8000. But I went in and fact-checked all of them and they are not 8000 Trump lies. The Washington Post is lyinghttps://1stamender.com/article.php?articlenumber=1416 We should regulate the media with legislation. They need to be held accountable for their lies. It should be far easier to sue them with slander and libel. I think the public awareness/outrage is just getting started and we should give it a little more time to see if legislation is really necessary. How many decades of abuse from the media before you act?I've been watching this stuff since the 90's. Very dangerous. That means the government sets a baseline for how the press should function and potentially determine what they can report or can't  which is a direct 1st amendment violation. So is any gun regulation. We've done it. We shouldn't.The ones who abuse free speech are the same that call for more gun regulations. I don't feel either is correct but if they can get guns regulated the press must be regulated as well.Libel and slander should be easier to sue them with. Their sources should be recorded and when the story and it's consequences are realized it should be made publicly available maybe even through FOIA requests or directly on the news web sites. That way if they've made something up and have no source or the source lied can be confirmed by public scrutiny and they can be sued otherwise. I'll give the Nobel prize some credit they did admit they were mistaken in giving Obama a peace prize due to his drone strike usage. I don't. They gave it to him for kissing everyone's ass that did nothing in the end.

I wonder if it's always been this way and I'm just noticing the ridiculousness of all these awards now or if it's just gotten corrupted over time. They should keep the prizes.

Holy COW!  I didn’t know about any of this!  He always seemed like a nice guy.  I hated Obama but Biden seemed okay.  This is horrible. I believe her as much as I believe Christine Ford. Just because she has a story that furthers my agenda doesn't mean I can look past the fact that she has no proof at all. We're not any better than they were if we suddenly believe some story like this.You cannot give one woman the power to veto an election with a story that she could have completely made up. Yes it's consistent with his other actions for which there is proof but to allow her 15 minutes of fame on this will come back to bite us later.No proof no 15 minutes. From either side.  There are enough videos that we don't need unproven allegations. We don't need to lower the bar so that any time some woman makes up a story it just automatically gets believed. Theres definitely more reason to believe this women compared to Christine Blasey Ford.In terms of Kavanaugh the supposed event happened and then for the next 30 Years literally no one came out with any allegations that he did anything akin to what Ford was accusing him of. He volunteered for women sports team he hired tons of women and not a single allegation. People who did what Ford accuse him of would likely repeat the same actionsIn terms of Biden however there are tons of videos of him acting incredibly creepy to both grown women and young women.That's not to say that we should crucify him without any evidence however this is 100 times more believable than Ford's allegations Draw a line. Not for this incident but for the future. Unless you want to hand the power to change the direction of the country to any woman who had a chance encounter with any future leader.There's evidence and there's not. Here there's not. She needs to stfu.By the way I fully agree with you. And I don't care. Trust but verify.Until there's some actual solid evidence the best policy here is just to withhold judgement.Biden sure is handsy though. Lots of picture of what looks like joe Biden smellin women from behind Take a look for yourselfI agree we need to be critical of accusations like Blasey Ford but unlike that case Biden has publically been inappropriatte with women of all ages for years in plain sight. I've yet to see any pictures of Kavanaugh hammered or being inappropriate with women and the inforamtion from his yearbook was from over 30 years ago we've seen nothing of the sort since he's been in the public spotlight. Biden on the other hand has been captured being inappropriate with women for years now including when he was VP of the country. This accusation isn't radical it clearly narrates whats already been captured on film. Joe Biden is a creep. Well when you put it that way it just sounds weird! Yes and we should focus on them. There are so many of them we dont need the least credible one. Apparently she's a Bernie ally. Fuck her unproven story. I’d much rather have joe Biden then bernie as president if trump lost I don’t hate joe Biden just saying these pictures and stories will hurt joe Biden’s chances It's good to be skeptical of course and I know nothing about this lady or the veracity of her claims.However throw her claims in the dumpster disregard them entirely and look up ""Creepy Joe biden"" on youtube and tell me what you find.With Kavanaugh the nonsense was made up on the spot for political reasons.  With Biden this stuff has been known about for years and years. You're missing my point.  I'm NOT being skeptical.  I'm establishing a standard going forward.  That means the NEXT Kavennaugh accuser should be held to the same standard.I'm not an idiot.  I know all about Creepy Joe.  Any conservative has been bombarded with this information.  I absolutely believe what she is saying and I absolutely believe she should either produce evidence or STFU and that everyone should be held to the same standard no matter how believable no matter how consistent with other incidents etc. I agree the internet invites the idea that viral means truth and that is so dangerous to follow because how are we suppose to have a functional judicial system when the jury consists of people who may have seen specific articles or videos and now have a preconceived bias. Innocent until proven guilty always. Actually i see it like you. Just make a nice video of joes best days and we got a cool spot to play as ad 24/7.

xFYD_,The views of Chick-fil-A do not represent our state or the Western New York communityTrue a lot of people are very angry at the Chick-fil-A in Rochester because it has caused a perpetual traffic jam in the area. This is a problem for Chik fil as everywhere.. It literally spills over into one of the roads near my workplace sometimes. Absolute madmen. They could build a second one right across the street from the one near my home and the lines would still probably stretch out to the street.  It does almost reach nuisance-level. Sounds like they need more of them There is a plan to build another one but this time they are going to redo the road to accommodate the traffic. New York is a welcoming state...Unless you expected us to welcome you into the world Or to keep your money in your pocket. Boo hoo Chick-fil-A is a private company whose owners have their own political and religious views. Suck it up leftists. Buffalo-Niagara? You sure they're not doing that just to get the word out that Buffalo-Niagara has an airport? The stupidest part about this fucking hoax is calling Chick-Fil-A anti-LGBT.They've done NOTHING anti-LGBT. Just a Chief of Ops who expressed a traditional view of marriage.THAT'S. IT.Fucking SWJ NPCs can't read and think Chick-Fil-A is screening for LGBT at the entrances... Chick-Fil-A:  We make chicken sandwiches.  We don't discriminate against anyone.  Any type of person can work here or buy a chicken sandwich here.  Yes the COO of our company is a Christian conservative.  Anyway would you like to buy a chi-Leftists: GET OUT OF HERE NAZIS! If I owned this company I would make very very large donations to the assemblyman's opponents in both his next primary and next election. So the airlines themselves are private companies but who owns the airport? If it's the government then doesn't this infringe on CFA's freedom of speech? San Antiono is owner by the city. Buffalo is owned by a New York state public-benefit corporation.New York state public benefit corporations and authorities operate like quasi-private corporations with boards of directors appointed by elected officials overseeing both publicly operated and privately operated systems. Public authorities share characteristics with government agencies but they are exempt from many state and local regulations They would likely still be restricted by the first amendment much like how courts have found transit authority's cannot exercise viewpoint discriminqtion against those that wish to advertise on buses and subways. Eugene Volokh says it does.http://reason.com/volokh/2019/03/26/san-antonio-violates-chick-fil The views of Chick-fil-A do not represent our state or the Western New York community.The view of Chicfila don't represent me either because they are a chicken restaurant. They have tasty fucking chicken and even better service. I don't ask Home Depot how they feel about capital gains or foreign aid when I buy mulch... Remember when conservatives pulled Nike and Converse stores from public malls?Me neither. Yet these same airports have CNN - go figure. They should demand to have both - CFA will quench your hunger CNN will cause you to lose your lunch. Rinse repeat... Now I want Chick-Fil-A and it's Sunday.  FML!

Clatsop,"Doctors say the brain can't feel pain.  Those doctors should watch this clip.

Wouldn't that be considered cat-calling? Not his style. Good Lord she is a dolt. its honestly amazing she got elected.  i feel like i should grab my labcoat and study her with as much fervor as i can muster. I'm torn between wanting her to be a one term congresswoman for the danger she possess the the nation and wanting here to stay in office for the entertainment she provides. Alexandria CowFarts Cortez is at it again folks. Trump would destroy her in a debate. Just study sociology.   She's nothing special  Just  an empty headed cover girl the money people could use. She may have a point. My husband produces a lot of methane when he eats grains too. /s I mean she's not entirely wrong. Methane (emitted in great amounts by livestock) is theoretically a major member in the factors that ""cause"" global warming. Assuming for a minute that global warming is entirely real and as bad as people say it is going after things like methane and international shipping would make a lot more sense than things like cars that have a comparatively tiny effect.It's just that her ways of actually achieving this is insane and completely wrong economically and morally. Methane is a natural waste product that every animal produces. There’s not much you can really do about it. I believe in man-influenced climate change but trying to control something like cow farts is absolutely ridiculous and not where the bulk of the problem lies. I thought there was a thing about giving cows seaweed that cut down on that but it could have been bullshit Heh. Bull shit. Probably but I found the article I was thinking ofhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjtgIuprqvhAhVR71QKHVzyBGQQzPwBegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technologyreview.com%2Fs%2F612452%2Fhow-seaweed-could-shrink-livestocks-global-carbon-hoofprint%2F&psig=AOvVaw2FBXKxiyT2g6lW77zN8FUV&ust=1554086721372339 I was referring to male cows a bulls...punny indeed.Edit: so it’s burps not farts. Not as humorous but still.Red algae may be added to our diet. My husband has...gas issues. Haha I’m a dumbass Nah. Lol Just to add an easy way to sound smart: it's cow burps not farts. Why is it ridiculous and not where the bulk of the problem lies?  Can you quantify these statements?Also it could be entirely possible that even though all animals produce methane cows do so at a significantly higher rate than other animals per pound of meat produced.I say this as someone who has been around cows a lot and is generally curious.  They do fart a lot.  Even though it sounds stupid I'd like to see the science on it before I judge.Edit:So I did some basic digging for you all.  Livestock accounts for about 14.5 percent of all green house gas emissions with cow burps being the primary offenders.  Not massive but not negligible either.Source: https://ideas.ted.com/methane-isnt-just-cow-farts-its-also-cow-burps-and-other-weird-facts-you-didnt-know-about-this-potent-greenhouse-gas/Edit 2: Those of you downvoting me for what?  For asking you to use a source and to use numbers when you say things?  Get your act together. https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-dataMethane only accounts for 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Yes most of that is from agriculture but the biggest offender is carbon dioxide emissions at 65% produced by the energy and transportation industries. Yes on a mass basis maybe but also here is a direct qoute from the article I linked:""Carbon dioxide may be the most prevalent greenhouse gas (accounting for 81 percent of emissions) but methane is much more potent. Over a 20-year period it traps 84 times more heat.""Also of note: “Methane pollution causes one quarter of the global warming that we’re experiencing right now” says Fred Krupp of the Environmental Defense Fund",0,False,t3_b7e3w2,31,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b7e3w2/alexandria_ocasiocortez_doubles_down_on_danger_of/,116,,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Doubles Down on Danger of Cow Farts at Bonkers Town Hall,116,https://www.redstate.com/bonchie/2019/03/30/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-doubles-danger-cow-farts-bonkers-town-hall/

Much of them settled in present day Pakistan. And then the Islamic Invasion of India happened a couple hundred years passed and now some Parsis live in Pakistan a country that is over 90% Muslim.

optionhome,This obviously happens everyday since the lying liberal media and the dnc are one and the same.  Though interesting that his guy revealed this particular incident. Not really to surprising I’m sure now that the mueller investigation is over more stories will start coming out. The reason it isn’t that surprising is the same reason there aren’t a lot of right leaning protests not like the left at least. I think that has to do with job security I think these reporters and journalists were bullied by their superiors to write and do things a certain way and I feel like a lot of them did it for the paycheck and not because they actually agreed with it. I have a friend very apolitical he doesn’t put his loyalty on a party he puts it on a policy and he has openly admitted and I quote ‘if someone were to walk up to me today and offered me money to protest trump which it has to be a good bit of money I’ll protest whatever you tell me as long as I’m getting paid for it.’ These are not news networks.

Yes Europe and the US should have kept the industrial revolution to themselves /s Don't bring up Climate Change statistics to Europeans..they just blame Western countries for 3rd world countries' emissions.Source: I tried The only argument along those lines I've heard is that it's our fault being such large consumers of plastics and moving our factories over there. To which I immediately stump them with ""which is why we should focus on moving jobs back to the US and winning the trade war with China."" If you are talking tariffs we shouldn’t do that. Tariffs do not actually benefit the US in any way. People have to spend more on tariff goods which means they have less money to invest in the economy. If we don’t have tariffs Americans save money on goods which they can invest in the economy and the other countries also make money that they use to trade with the world economy which will eventually make it back to us. Tariffs benefit us in the long term if we use them correctly. Otherwise it’s just a tax on incoming goods yes. No. That’s not how economics works. It forces Americans to spend more on products thus giving them less money to invest in the economy in other ways. When we buy products from other countries Americans save money and we inject funds in the world economy which in the long run makes it back to us. Tariffs are a valuable political tool; from the punishment of stealing intellectual property to the manipulation of economies of rival countries to encouraging the reciprocal lowering of tariffs in other countries.Just saying ""tariffs are bad"" is ignoring the political reality of their usage for the US' benefit.Yes in an ideal world every country would have humane labor laws be our political ally not steal intellectual property and have zero import/export tariffs. Punishment of stealing intellectual property to the manipulation of economies of rival countries to encouraging lowering of tariffs in other countries.You assume that placing tariffs on foreign goods and services will encourage rival countries into lowering tariffs stop manipulating their economy and stealing intellectual property. None of those endgoals will be fulfilled for good reason. This unlevel playing field argument evaporates before the facts: since 1981 when the United States last enjoyed a surplus in the trade of manufactured goods the levels of protection have not changed much (except in the United States where it has gone up). As for Japan reputedly our most unfair trading partner its proportion of the U.S. trade deficit hardly grew at all from 1981 to 1985. Protectionists usually couch their claims in terms of saving particular industries from imports as with shoes lumber and steel pipe. The facts show however that tariffs and quotas seldom save jobs for long or preserve the competitiveness of the industry to be “saved.” Meanwhile of course the consumer suffers through higher prices. While subsidies tariffs and similar practices affect the mix of trade over the medium run they do not affect the trade balance which is driven by a nation’s spending and saving patterns. A country with investment opportunities exceeding its domestic savings will borrow from abroad and run a trade deficit even if its costs are relatively low its home markets protected and its exports subsidized. Conversely a nation with high savings relative to investment will run a trade surplus even if its markets are open and its products sell poorly. The recent deterioration in the U.S. trade position resulted from the decline in net national saving when the growing budget deficit far outstripped any increase in net private saving.It is not the purpose of government to interfere with individual transactions and agreements that make up the U.S. economy or the global economy. The government cannot predict the future actions of the millions of individuals whom make up an economy Tariffs are taxes. Taxes reduce consumption and make life worse for consumers who are also producers in other industries. The government is not a magical god with the capacity to correctly predict which industries are worth preserving. To believe otherwise is to embrace the chief fallacy of central planning. You assume that placing tariffs on foreign goods and services will encourage rival countries into lowering tariffs stop manipulating their economy and stealing intellectual property. None of those endgoals will be fulfilled for good reason.They do from trade deals to trade embargos... The economic purchasing power marketplace and currency of the US affords it massive leverage in any political/economic negotiation. Both ends of the spectrum; From North Korea and Cuba to India and Singapore.The rest of your long rant is completely unrelated to what I said. I made no argument about ""saving jobs"" or the first order economic benefits of zero tariff systems. I didn't mention ""trade balances"" because I don't care. I even followed up my statements saying that in a perfect world tariffs (like all taxes btw) would be zero.Tariffs are a tool to achieve an end nothing more. If you are stupid enough to use a hammer to wash your dishes and it doesnt work it isn't because hammers are inherently bad. Tariffs are not embargoes they are a tax placed on consumer goods and looking back on history tariffs always escalate and hurt everyone in a trade war and do not necessarily lead to better trade deals. They are not effective political tools not economic tools. Governments have free trade no trade and everything in between. Your refusal to acknowledge that a country like the US can flex its economic strength to get what it wants from other countries is really ignorant at best. Complex multiplayer economic games don't just result in dum-dum surface level econ 101 benefits.I urge you to avoid using economic theory as a purist religion in an idealized utopia but rather as a foundational grounding for your beliefs. Your rant comprised almost entirely of counterpoints to things I didnt argue is evidence of your emotional attachment to dogma rather than acknowledgement of the complexities of human reality.Your insistence that ""every tariff is bad"" is not born out in reality any more than the ""every tariff is good"" crowd it lives in the same utopia lala land that anarcho communists or open border freedom of labor people live in. You didn’t even ask what I meant by “correctly” which is “getting others to agree to free trade”. Do you not think that increasing tariffs will only lead to the other side increasing tariffs? Totally depends on the situation and country.  We can often throw our weight around and get what we want. Can’t be a very good consumer if you don’t have job You cant be a very good consumer either when tariffs force the prices of goods to go up either and do a disservice to domestic companies by protecting them from foreign and possibly better competition. It doesn’t matter if the cost goes up .50 cents for socks if you don’t have a job And how will tariffs save jobs? Encourages domestic manufacturing Tariffs are bad in an economic sense however a country's concerns are much larger than economic efficiency. National Security internal stability and other such concerns need to be balanced with economic efficiency. I agree the average American will pay but I don't see it as much as people think it will be.The fundamental problem with China is that the great economic prosperity it has enjoyed for decades has resulted in China enlarging and improving its military. It has grown into a rival with the United States in numerous different fields. This was done through exporting and is still reliant on exporting.There is also evidence that China has lost its comparative advantage in much of its trade and that continued production is do to momentum and fixed capital in China. Mexico is usually a better place to build stuff and even the United States turns out better in certain fields due to more consistent higher quality products. Tariffs on China will help speed up the offshoring of Chinese jobs that is already happening. Tariffs do not actually benefit the US in any way.We have laws against dumping plastic in the ocean. That makes our products slightly more expensive than products made elsewhere. So now we buy from other people who dump plastic in the ocean. If only there was a mechanism for punishing countries that do not hold their corporations to the same standards perhaps so we could encourage Americans not to buy products from said country. This. Tariffs and taxes on foreign goods only make goods more expensive for the citizens. Trade deficit is not a bad thing Tariffs and taxes on foreign goods only make goods more expensive for the citizens.Tariffs are a valuable political tool; from the punishment of stealing intellectual property to the manipulation of economies of rival countries to encouraging the reciprocal lowering of tariffs in other countries.Trade deficit is not a bad thingCorrect. A trade deficit is not inherently bad. Fuckin' white people Well obviously it’s our fault if we don’t pay billions to get others to stop. Well some of the plastic is stuff that's exported from the West. Including 10% of China's waste according to the article. https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/11/china-ban-plastic-trash-imports-shifts-waste-crisis-southeast-asia-malaysia/ Colonialism!!Edit: I assumed the sarcasm was clear. So your saying all the plastic is due to Trump backing out of the Paris accord? The YouTube channel 1791 has an excellent video about the Accord. I want to say it's called A Worthless Agreement or something like that. They display their usual attractive graphics and quality audio while going through and dismantling any merit the Paris Accord had explaining how it wouldn't help at all. Do you have a link? Not OP but here's a link. It's only 7:32 so not a long watch but I think it's worth a look.https://youtu.be/A_Oelbi0HuY Thanks!Edit in: that was a really interesting video. Worth the watch for anyone interested. 1791 is easily one of my favorite YouTube videos. The graphics are attractive and it's generally just pleasant to listen to. While they are a little bit verbose they're also articulate and well-researched. I'd absolutely recommend checking out their other videos.

[deleted],"Top Tards Last time NPCs tried that Chick-fil-A had a banner quarter. I had never had chick-fil-a before the last boycott. But with everybody talking about them I decided to try it. I've been eating their at least 1x a week since. Wokeness ends where tendies begin for the left.  These boycotts do nothing. ""Thanks for the free publicity "" -  Chick-Fil-A I remember the Gay Kiss-In they had to protest Chick-fil-a. I was at a Chicken Express that was in the parking lot of a mall that had a chick-fil-a in it and there were 2 confused gay guys kissing in front of the Chicken Express by mistake.One of my funniest memories. Nice! chick fil a is good and all but I'd do unspeakable things for some chicken express right now. and taco cabana too. Boycotting Chick-fil-a fell flat on its face when it was a huge media push for it a few years ago. I wouldn't expect that this is going anywhere now that nobody really cares what their stance is on gay marriage or whatever. I just hate public airports banning them.  Would they ban a non-Christian leaning business?  Obviously not. One of the biggest things that concerns me right now is the top-down ideological enforcement going on in every strata of American culture and economy.It wasn't until the last five years or so that this took hold but it's clear that the people who control the marketplaces whether virtually or physically have decided that what they believe has a bigger precedent on their business decisions than does the demands of consumers. And that's very worrying.The only way they can get away with this is if they have so much control that they can do as they please despite consumer demand which they do. In a strange turn of events the Marxists have used capitalism to seize control of the means of production. The term is Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) and it managed to infect the top business schools. A bunch of ideologues taught people that the way to make money is to listen their commissars. It won't work in the long run but the activists don't care. They are happy to run everything into the ground as long as they get their way. Plus the professors won’t be affected until everything has gone down the drain. Diversity training is mandatory in a ton of different industries both private and public. You have to either conform or go home Conservatives are against hiring non-whites? Or what's your issue with diversity? Businesses ought to hire the most qualified candidates regardless of race. Boycotting is free market. People should be allowed to shop where they want. Agreed. Diversity training isn't about hiring practices it's corporate virtue signaling requiring everyone to narrowly view each other's ""differences"" through pre-formed filters like white privilege etc. Tons of studies show they're actually counter-productive in terms of fostering better relations across different divisions and instead lead to more resentment and sexual harassment claims being taken less seriously. No one gets anything from them unironically. Virtue signaling? You mean PR? Like companies trying to sell more stuff to people is bad? It's bad if it's a counter-productive and unnecessary hassle for employees. Low wages are a hassle and counterproductive for employees too. I know it's changing the topic but maybe if you believe in the free market you should just let companies do what they want and let consumers do what you want? Or are you the type of conservative who thinks the government should force companies to stop diversity training and ban speech that calls for boycotts?",0,False,t3_b7cs2f,79,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b7cs2f/chickfila_is_being_boycotted/,81,In light of the boycotting Chick-fil-a is receiving I'd like to encourage everyone to patronize this fine fast food establishment at least once a week and let them know you are part of a group that appreciates them.

chabanais,The melt is the key. We don’t melt enough anymore. Except for all the snowflakes. A melting point where the chef chooses the ingredients not a melting pot that just collects the stuff that falls off other tables. America shouldn't be an Irish stew (no offense to the Irish..it's the figure of speech).   We should have a little say in the ingredients and the mix from those presented to us. We melt; slowly.  Melting takes (at least) three generations.  Patience is a virtue.   In an age of instant gratification we may have lost that patience.Think about it; simplistically gen 1:  an immigrant.  Aren't comfortable here or we with them (Irish need not apply).   Gen 2  Their kids have one foot in the Old Country but are completely living in America.  Gen 3.  Americans period.  The Old Country may be a source of pride or disdain or traditions but their home is here. The left has intentionally undermined the melting pot through multiculturalism. Without assimilation there is no America once a people United by ideals. Classically liberal ideals. Once socialism started infecting America it started tearing us apart.

Charlie8005,"I'm not ignorant to this idea I'm a Reagan Republican (old school).  I think what's most interesting for me personally is that I wasn't expecting Trump to deliver.  I expected his presidency to be a carnival and in many ways it has been but we might agree that it's not Trump who is pitching the tent.  In the end I underestimated him.  I won't do that again. I'm completely onboard with this. Reagan was the best president in my lifetime (I'm in my late 40's). i switched to Libertarian around 2010 when it became obvious the GOP was just Big Gov't party B.Absentee Voted for Rand Paul in the primary only to watch him drop out the same day. I didn't even vote in the general it was Team Clown (Trump) or Team Criminal (Hillary) for me. Hell I didn't care who won i just wanted to see Hillary lose. i was shocked when it happened.I wasn't expecting anything but a circus from Trump. I was shocked when he began actually delivering. i don't care for him he's crass he's a bully he tweets stupid shit like 'complaining about SNL ffs.' He's the worst public speaker in recent memory.But let's face it. Things are going pretty good. If nothing else we're going to have a 6-3 or even a 7-2 majority on the Supreme Court by the time he gets out of office in 2025. And due to the age of the Justices we'll hold that majority for a couple decades at least. Trump does run a carnival but behind the scenes he's also running a great government. That's the difference. I own soy bean farm. I'm fucked. Can you grow weed? Friend bought a 3 row planter and is growing 30 acres of hemp this year. USMCA would be a huge boost. Not sure why Trump doesn’t finished that and help us farmers out a little at least. Seems like the details are already ironed out for the most part. Russia has already bought the lion share of the soy that China used to buy from us. I know none of this is direct correlation or a anything. I never PERSONALLY sold my crops to China or had to watch my stock rot. But I am in the negative this year for the first time in over a decade. With razor think profits this is pretty catastrophic. We'll manage though. Can't point fingers but the tariffs didn't do any help. We aren't at full potential yet.  Trump has only unleashed as much potential as he can.  We have a lot farther to go but we will need to elect more outsiders who ally with Trump into Congress to get there. Day he got elected I didn’t know exactly where I leaned in politics. Posted on facebook that the results were surprising but I’d give him a chance. Then I went through saying what an idiot he is and the things he says. But now I plan to vote for him. Never did I expect to see results like this from him can’t really say if it’s him or just republican policy being implemented but in my eyes it’s working.Also seeing the absolute insanity from the left over the past 2 and a half years has really put me over the edge. Used to consider myself a liberal and was more of a moderate democrat now I’m somewhere with the libertarian/conservative right. You've been brainwashed your whole life to think that the right wing is evil.  Most of the people vilified by the left as alt right believe in left wing policies.  It's hilarious how many people buy the lies.The truth is this is America.  Even the right wing here is liberal.  Just liberal with a strong dose of reality mixed in. Most of the people vilified by the left as alt right believe in left wing policies. It's hilarious how many people buy the lies.That's definitely true. If you look at many of the so-called ""far right"" European parties or read some of what the actually alt-right nutjobs propound most of them want a large government that acts against non-whites. A lot of what he says is just off the cuff rambling.  Sometimes it's great sometimes not so much.  The left try to act like everything he says is considered gospel to anyone who doesn't hate him.  I didn't realize how many people just don't understand giving eachother shit. The number of morons that think he ""colluded"" with Russia on national tv to find Hilary's emails blows my mind. I’m with you.  Didn’t vote for him in the primary held my nose and voted against Hillary in November of 2016.In 2020 I’ll be enthusiastically voting for Trump. No disrespect to your political beliefs but all I see in this thread is everyone praising Trump without mentioning  the things he did that could have potentially had impact.The economy has been in a bull run since 2008 so how exactly is Trump supposed to be responsible for this?There is a lot of false rallying/spin information in politics so I am asking out of genuine curiosity. If you really wanted an answer you live in the age of available information.  But you probably don’t want an answer.  You seek information that confirms what you want to believe then put the onus of research on those with whom you disagree so you call tell yourself you won by getting the last word. Nice reply that's not really the information I wanted. But thanks for confirming you are autistic. I know what you mean I also suffered greatly in 2008 and during the lingering aftermath.  My story is a sad one.A lot of people don't realize this but there's a reason why Trump was elected against all the odds against him (arguably unqualified volatile untested risky) and a big part of that is the legacy of 2008.  We no longer believed either party could help us because they're all insiders looking after the interests of insiders.  Only a true outsider could help.That's why we saw hope in Trump.  Yes he says wacky things and that's part of his charm to me anyway but we needed someone to shake up the establishment system.  And that's exactly what he's done to the limits of his abilities despite the best efforts of the CIA and the corrupt deep state to stage a soft coup against him.But his job is far from done.  We still need concrete immigration reform and to finish the wall.  This country cannot survive in it's current form given the onslaught of illegal and legal immigration that we're subjected to on a yearly basis.  Obama's promise of fundamental transformation is still very much a future reality as long as the flood gates of people yearning to vote for socialism keep flooding into this country.  Ocasio-Cortez is not a temporary aberration she is rising and others will rise like her unless we shut the doors and begin the difficult and time consuming process of assimilation of 10's of millions of foreign born here who do not comprehend why this place is so special (and their home countries they fled from are not). Same here.  2008 hit me HARD and I fed myself by making plasma donations for a while.   Like the OP I didn't vote in the last election for the same reasons.  I did think that the one thing Trump had going for him was that he didn't need constituents to back him.  He had enough money to bypass the usual route.Results are results and meanwhile the left has become terrifying in the past two years.   Better believe I will run to the polls like my life depends on it. And yet inexperienced millennials still think socialism is a better option for the working man. Capitalism will always be the fairest system. That will never change.Congrats on getting your life back on track. There is a great campus reform video going around right now where he asks college students if they prefer capitalism or socialism. They all say socialism.Then he asks if they would be okay giving away their GPA points to those who have lower GPAs and they all say “hell no”He asks them why and they say “I worked hard for my grades why would I give it away to someone who didn’t work as hard?”He then says “how is that any different than someone who works hard for their money having to give it away to someone who doesn’t work hard for their money”No answers. That's the problem right there. They don't actually know what socialism entails it's just a buzzword thrown around campuses creating a form of identity politics where anyone with compassion needs to believe in it. The unfortunate truth is that they need to experience it to realise how devastating the effects can be which is what will probably happen in the near-ish future. I can think of so many things better then capitalism. But one  it's so precise it will take century to perfect  2 someone with even the smallest amount of greed ruins it.Which is why capitalism is the best If your system easily fails then it's not better than capitalism. Ik that That's why I said the thing below it  capitalism is the best Not trying to be a dick here but what the fuck is better than capitalism? Pray tell. Well I had a betteridea a few weeks ago but one simple one is capitalism except you have to pay tax according to where you get most of revenue from cough cough apple The carnival came from the Dems and rhino republicans Trumps only issue I can see is that he calls it like it is and calls them out for what they are. I am ok with that because he has done and will do a lot of great things. Like you I thought he was just going to show boat and go along to get along. He is just what this country needed he has substance and my support The recession hurt me badly too. I was scrapping metal at one point to try to make ends meet. I’m doing great now. I own a business and I’ve learned to invest money and trade stocks. This economy is great! Sure Trump says things and tweets stuff that makes me cringe but he’s also under constant attack from the psycho left more than anybody before him. I kinda think he is trolling for fun. I’m married to a black woman that once was a democrat but now a huge Trump supporter. She will throw hands when someone lies about her president. He is the greatest president of my lifetime and he has the balls to stand his ground. All I can say is Trump in 2020!!

I was successful and happy to live my little life.  The worries started in 2008 when the financial company I was with had to close its doors rather suddenly.  I had experienced hiccups in my career before or moved jobs before but this was like nothing I'd ever seen.  For my talent and experience I couldn't get arrested.  I lost everything.

So went the next eight years.  

I struggled and I moved around place to place trying to get back to good but it felt like the opportunities that had once been there were gone and it felt like forever.  I sold t-shirts for a while.  I went from excess to floating bills and trying to keep the lights on.  

I always vote but I didn't vote last round.  I couldn't.  I thought Trump was crazy and Hilary was ... well *no*.  

These past two years have seen a change that I would never have thought possible.  The economy rebounded so fast that I wasn't sure what was happening.  And then doors began to open again and I walked through one of them and now I have my life back again.

I'm not a kid I've seen presidents come and go but I've never felt an effect as tangible as what I am experiencing now.  This is deeply personal to me - my life has changed.

I still think Trump is a little crazy but I'm down with it and I will literally run to the polls to re-elect him.  And if you think I'm the exception you're nuts.

Shut the fuck up criminals wouldn’t DREAM of breaking the law Now there will be an arms race then pandemonium. “Save a life surrender your knife”?Whose life exactly am I saving? Certainly not mine. Considering I don’t go around stabbing others willynilly it’s none of my friends’ lives either.I can only think its a criminal’s life I might spare in the event I am attacked. Sound reasonable. Sure take all my knives.-no sane person. What kind of idiot thinks that turning in your own knife would save anybody unless you were planning on stabbing people? What kind of stabber planner would turn in their own murder weapon? What kind of fucking OAF thinks this does anything but give the actual criminals a big box of knifes (from people who weren’t going to hurt anybody) to break into??They basically just asked a bunch of normal people to turn in some harmless knives so they could be redistributed into the hands of criminals.

They only let people through if they’re coming here IIRC. Sounds strict. Just like closing the border this should have been done long ago. Good.  Screw 'em.

Mexico is complicit as well in that they're not stopping the caravans at their southern border. Do we have a decent legit estimate for refugees coming from these countries?

optionhome,"Sandy Doubles Down: Part II You never go full Sandy. Well if you actually thought that then maybe you shouldn't have ""told the senate to vote present"". Do we even know that she did that or did she just try to take credit for it afterwards as a power move? I think it is only reasonable that she is trying to take credit. The DNC would be put of their mind from a strategic perspective if it got out that fall line behind her. Its not a power move. Just a way to try and save face. Didn’t they vote “present” or is that the same as pass? I have no idea why I wrote pass. You are correct. Sort of like they figured out that the overwhelming majority of their party is composed of the brain dead and perpetually stupid.  So they chose a Queen of the Idiots to lead them. I came across her fawning Rolling Stone interview last night.Even when she gets the softest of softball questions she doesn't help herself.

I certainly haven't and I'm not the laziest guy around so I can only guess about others.Isn't it kind of humorous to watch two groups of people fighting each other over something they haven't looked into?

She was playing with dunkaroos when the planes hit.  I can't believe anyone who was conscious during 9/11 would compare the two events.  I forgot she also compared it to World War II.  I'm sure living in London and getting bombed every night is just like climate change.  This idiot is the epitome of a generation who has never even suffered living without cell phones and air conditioning.

optionhome,Every notice how conservative talk radio loves to have guest or callers who are leftists.  Levin always puts them on immediately a head of all other callers.  Hannity loves to have on leftist guests for debate.  But even in what's left of leftist talk radio they never allow the other side to be heard. that's because conservatives of General love to be. Because they have facts on their side. Liberals are scared to be because they know that they are lying. It's very obvious when you talk about Facebook censoring anybody that disagrees with themIt's a problem that needs to be fixed It's a shame- back when I had Sirius radio in my car I would occasionally listen 127 Progress- the progressive station obviously.Hartmann was the only one that was at least somewhat sane.

postonrddt,"Top Tards Brigading  Progressives want to pack the courts delete the second amendment limit the first and scrap the electoral college the first chance they get. This guy knows that but still rather have socialism as long as he gets to stick it to Trump. Oh yes this guy is a real Benedict Arnold. Hey Arnold was at least a well loved hero before he flipped. He a faux Republican conservative. Or not too bright.It was a Republican that proposed top two voting in California. Look at California now. A one party state without a Republican in site. In this day and age the Republicans could conceivably not recover for decades. And more importantly the damage done could also take decades to undo. On the bright side California is a prime example how progressive policies can destroy an entire state; moderates and centrists are watching. The greater good of the Democrat party that is. And now you see why he was so ""popular"" in Arizona. But he’s a ""principled conservative""LMAO This guy just keeps showing what a flake he is... Oh wait.. thats his NAME.... What a case of a name describing the person.... I instantly ignore anyone who uses the phrase ""the greater good"". What makes you so sure that you know what's best for everyone else? I’m willing to see Flake lose to protect the GOP from moderates who aren’t actually conservatives.  After all look at what the State of Arizona elected as their new governor. Is Flake just McCain reincarnated? That may have been true in the past. But he used a personal feud with Trump to sabotage the entire country; he flat-out lied to his Congressional colleagues (changed his vote within hours of promising to repeal Obamacare) and the voters of Arizona. Party lines mean nothing anymore. McCain has spent 30 years championing the most establishment things imaginable. The only time he was a true conservative was when his re-election hopes depended on it. Look up how he shifted his positions each time when he was in danger of losing his seat. Whenever anyone criticized him he and his supporters defaulted back to this ""war hero"" stuff. I think Trump's comments in 2015 were wrong because just as you said it insults other POW's but just a reminder that this was in response to McCain's appaling comments that Trump supporters in Arziona were ""crazies"" and when Trump criticized McCain's career in general the interviewer said he was a war hero. It's not a counterargument and it can't be used as a defense against your shitty career. And regardless of how he ended up voting Trump disrespected him and every other veteranLolnoAnyone who supports our troops should despise how Trump spoke about McCain.Or you know you could just believe that ""support our troops"" has always been a shitty establishment politician line like ""for the children"" ""family values"" ""love not hate"" etc.. I've never claimed to be a gung-ho jingoistic military hawk and I have no problem admitting that anyone in the military who hates the First Second etc. Amendments or hates people like me because of the immutable characteristics we were born with is my enemy. Trump's comments were awful I agree. But for someone who survived 5 years of captivity to become so butt-hurt over some tweets that he'd side with the enemy shows me he was not a real leader. He should've know better especially after running for president.Tbh I don't even remember why Trump attacked McCain in the first place. Usually Trump responds to attacks against him but I've kinda lost track. I do remember it was during the GOP primaries. Butthurt Brigader I’ll probably get downvoted for saying this in here but I thought John McCain was pretty widely regarded as a very respected war veteran before Trump started insulting him.Genuine right-wingers and left-wingers by and large didn't have a voice or a platform for much longer before that point either.John McCain is a war criminal and roasting in the 9th circle of hell along with some other choice mass murdering tyrants throughout history. He's a much worse person than Alex Jones Gavin McInnes Milo Yiannopolous or any of the other ""crazy and unreasonable far right"" types that liberals are conditioned into hating by the media. It speaks volumes when liberals condemn people as the worst specimens of humanity for doing petty shit like spreading conspiracy theories about school shootings or making fun of trannies or whatever but then turn around and say that a mass murdering war criminal who did more individual damage to the cause of human liberty than most Americans was one of the good Republicans because he called his own constituency nazis that one time or something.

SuperCharged2000,"Just ban killing sheep. Or just lock up all the sheep. There are so many presuppositions here.First the image is not comparing gun owners to wolves its comparing guns to teeth. People in society are both the wolves and the sheep with the logic being that the law-abiding citizens will voluntarily restrict themselves while the criminals (wolves) will just ignore that restriction.Second there is absolutely no correlation between how many guns someone owns and how likely they are to commit crime. The vast majority of ""stockpilers"" won't commit crimes and the vast majority of crimes are committed by people who only own one or two guns - or even none at all (obtaining them from a different source ie. most of the recent school shootings were done by people who accessed improperly stored guns)third the idea that a government database and algorithm will somehow stop crime... somehow. The idea of the government even putting together an effective system for it is asinine and even if it did work it would almost immediately be abused.Finally the big one: the supposition that gun crime is primarily a mental health issue. Flat. Out. Wrong. Mental health is an important issue and there are some high profile cases of violent crime related to mental health but ""mental illness"" does not explain the high rate of violent crime outside of the mass shooting we see in the media. Do you really think depression is what is causing the violence epidemic in Chicago? Or could there be other factors maybe i dunno not enough positive role models poor education lack of economic opportunity and mobility poverty a culture of violence and gang affiliation and a fundamental lack of moral guidance in the lives of young men? shut up ur being smart ur not allowed too guns are dangerous and im scared 😢 Saying people doing bad things is mental illness is incorrect. Also the point is that Controlling Guns dont prevent gun crime. Here on Brazil after our gun Control laws there was a increase on gun crime including a percentual increase. People who want to do crimes will not be prevented by the laws. And if people cant get Guns they Will use whatwver they can put their hands on cars improvised bombs construction tools knives Poison etc. Ever consider the possibility that mass shooters are evil pieces of garbage and not ""mentally ill""? Shooting innocent people is not the same as having a nervous twitch or a panic attack. 99% of people that stockpile weapons are just your everyday hardworking conservative southern man.Gun control won't ever work here. There are more guns than people. There will always be a black market where they're easy to get. I'm a felon and I could get a gun from a friend faster than you could buy one.Even if there was an insane multi trillion dollar military sweep of the country that got rid of 75% of guns we'd just become the UK where now they are outlawing knives because crazy people will kill you with anything 99% of people that stockpile weapons are just your everyday hardworking conservative southern man.I've always been under the notion that majority of people who collect firearms are actually more likely to use and store them properly and safely. They understand the dangers associated with firearms and treat them accordingly. Analogies are always bad under certain lights. I find others making analogies useful if only to help me understand where my interlocutor is coming from. ""Boxing is like ballet except the dancers hit each other"" - jack handey Did the sheep try talking to the wolf and explaining that killing sheep is wrong?  Obviously the wolf just needs to be educated on the benefits of a well balanced vegan diet. There was a sign up saying no eat sheep But was there a no teeth sign?  See the problem?  Need more signs. Don't forget the ""you must obey the signs"" sign! And less teeth! One tooth at most. No one needs a high capacity head full of assault teeth!!!! Ban assault tooths!!! Think of the lambs!!!! Did the sheep try talking to the wolf and explaining that killing sheep is wrong?They tried but their teeth were missing so the wolf couldn't understand what they were saying. I think what really happened is that no one informed the wolf that the area was a wolf free zone. The wolf must’ve been vaccinated causing him to not adhere to the laws Well balanced? Like the fact that even with an ""extremely balanced"" vegan diet the average person still needs to take supplements to make up for the heart-healthy fats and such they miss when not eating meat? r/whoosh Just take the wolf’s teeth out.

davidlah,"There reason I share this post is because I'm kinda confused about the word conservative in the Malaysian context. Here those who are religious are considered as conservatives. But I know that conservative value are more than just religious. The conservative in Malaysia have no concept of limited government freedom of speech and liberty. Majority of them wanted Shariah Law. Is there a standardization of conservative values across the globe or it's really different from country to country? Is there a standardization of conservative values across the globeNo. Full stop. Can you explain? Why wouldn't the temperament paradigm cover every single person in the entire world? I can't Goddamn well explain or refute the temperament paradigm if I have no idea what it is now can I? If you don't know what the temperament paradigm is how can you tell OP that there's no standard sets of ""conservative values""? Probably because I don't wrap myself in psychosociology and have a basic understanding of the writings of Edmund Burke. So your argument is that you're right and I'm wrong because there's no better understanding of the world or people now than there was 200 years ago.You understand that you're arguing the point of cultural relativism right?

Clatsop,Part of what’s so galling (and downright frightening) in this still-unfolding scheme is the arrogance the certitude that they would succeed without ever being suspected.It requires a level of hubris that should “invoke the wrath of the gods.” It was too much of a well-oiled machine. It really begs the question what other political opponents did they spy on? We know they were using the IRS Dept of Education and DoJ for political purposes. It is quite likely the corruption was much broader than that. It is quite likely the corruption was much broader than that.And begs the question of how long this has been going on.

Help. so if Commiefornia's ban is unconstitutional aren't other state bans also unconstitutional? Unfortunately the whole ""Gods in black robes"" only applies to King Hawaii Judge and other federal judges not district judges. Not yet. This is just for CA. 9th circuit will likely be forced to rule as CA appeals then we likely lose again then it gets heard by SCOTUS. It's a great start but we have years to go to hit other states. ever read how they passed that 15 round mag regulation you would be sickened by how they did it. Yeah. The politicians here are particularly disgusting sometimes in order to get their margin due to the state being so red outside of Denver. Luckily the grandfather clause in the ban makes it unenforceable I bought a couple 30 round mags a couple weeks ago legally in castle rock Yes... 'kits' for repair. It is enforceable though...Unfortunately new gun mags don't hold up to scrutiny. eg If the Scorpion came out after 2013 (it actually came out in 2009 but I can't think of another example) there's no way to be able to claim you had the mags before the ban.The ban is to get the younger generation used to it and keep the older generation mostly quiet because they at least have theirs. And the no transfer clause means you can't pass them on even after death.Finally anyone not at least 18 by July 2013 can never legally possess them under any circumstance. Ouch didn't know about the age restriction  that's bullshit It's not written... It's deduced from the law... No transfers allowed must be 18 to own a rifle. NY plz kthx And New York and Maryland and Connecticut too and Hawaii and Colorado and even Kalamazoo.

Clatsop,This article completely misses the mark.  Religion was involved in both revolutions but it was not a primary motivator.The difference between the American and French revolutions is that the American revolution was motivated by natural law and enlightenment values and the French revolution was motivated by class struggle.Marx obviously didn’t exist yet during the French revolution but the motivation was the same - poor people resenting the rich and wanting a piece of what they have.  Of course hereditary monarchy is unjust compared to a meritocratic wealthy class but either way a revolution motivated by jealousy and greed will always collapse on itself as the people who overthrow the old boss fight amongst themselves to become the new boss.The American revolution worked because the rich and poor were fighting for the same cause and were motivated by ideals not financial gain. French Revolution is a struggle to transfer the power of the government from the Monarchy to the Oligarchy (Bourgeoisie).American Revolution is a struggle to reduce the power of the government. In my opinion I think that acts of aggression against the government aren't justified no matter who tyrannical it is. However I don't think the American Revolution violated this principle because all they did was secede from Great Britain and defend themselves against Britain attacking them.,0,False,t3_b7e2th,3,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b7e2th/why_the_american_revolution_worked_and_the_french/,19,,Why the American Revolution Worked and the French Revolution Didn't,19,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2019/03/why_the_american_revolution_worked_and_the_french_revolution_didnt.html
ReaganTroll,U.S. stocks notched their biggest quarterly gains in nearly a decade lifted by bets that central banks would hold interest rates at low levels as global growth slows.Major indexes have now recouped almost all of the losses they suffered in the final months of 2018 when fears about an economic downturn sent markets around the world sliding.Much of this year’s rally was fueled by relief that central banks were willing to back off their rate-increase campaigns after growth cooled from the eurozone to China and stocks swooned investors and analysts said. Others attributed part of the rebound to investors stepping back into stocks after a selloff that many considered overdone.The market’s turnaround has helped whet investors’ appetite for what many believe could be one of the biggest years ever for IPOs. On Friday shares of ride-hailing firm Lyft Inc. rose 8.7% in their trading debut.Many believe the U.S. economy continues to be a relative bright spot around the world. Still indications that inflation remains muted have helped push the Federal Reserve to pause its rate-increase campaign. Some have called for the Fed to go even further: National Economic Council Director Lawrence Kudlow said Friday the Fed should lower its benchmark federal-funds rate by 50 basis points to help protect the U.S. economy.“Central bankers are finally catching up with not just the economic data but also the expectations” of investors said Mike Ryan chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management. That is a reversal from the fourth quarter when many investors feared the Fed’s plans at the time to continue raising rates in 2019 might tip a slowing economy into a downturn.The S&P 500 added 13% for the quarter its best showing since 2009 and rose 0.7% to 2834.40 on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday jumped 211.22 points or 0.8% to 25928.68 finishing the quarter up 11%. The Nasdaq Composite rose 60.16 points or 0.8% to 7729.32 and added 16% for the quarter.Gains were broad with all 11 S&P 500 sectors ending higher for the quarter for the first time since 2014.Technology shares extended a streak of gains that have made them the strongest-performing sector in the S&P 500 this year. Facebook Inc. and Netflix Inc. rose 27% and 33% respectively in the first quarter. Signs that profits continue to boom among technology-focused companies have helped drive share prices higher.Another standout in the first quarter: energy stocks. Shares of companies like Hess Corp. and Devon Energy Corp. soared more than 40% boosted by rising oil prices.Despite the rally of the past couple months U.S. stock indexes have yet to climb above the highs they hit last fall. Major indexes have flitted close to records only to retreat as fears about cooling economic momentum sparked a slide across stocks commodities and bond yields.The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note—considered a bedrock for global finance because it is used to help set borrowing costs—settled at 2.416% Friday up slightly from Thursday but well below the 2.684% where it ended last year.Yields which fall as bond prices rise have retreated around the world in recent weeks underscoring the tug of war investors say they are facing.Central banks’ softer approach to monetary policy this year has reassured investors that borrowing costs which can feed into corporate profits and consumer spending are unlikely to race out of control. Yet the sustained slide in bond yields throughout the quarter has left some investors wondering if stocks’ first-quarter rally is on shaky ground.One point of concern is that U.S. stocks’ banner first quarter has put major indexes above the point where some analysts had expected them to end the year. With economic growth cooling some investors question if a strong catalyst will emerge to churn stocks higher.“We’re not anticipating that we’re going to see a big enough earnings surprise to boost stock prices much higher than they are now” said Tracie McMillion head of global asset-allocation strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute.Some fund managers have also been unsettled by the disconnect between the stock and bond markets throughout the year. Stocks and bond yields typically rise in tandem—not diverge—when investors are confident about prospects for economic growth.“My hope is that the economy can grow out of this and give central banks some extended period of time to refocus” said Dan Miller director of equities at GW&K Investment Management.Mr. Miller is optimistic U.S. stocks can continue to carve out gains but he is wary of risks like continuing trade talks between the U.S. and China uncertainty over Brexit and a further pullback in growth in the eurozone.“There’s a lot of cross currents that are out there” he added.,0,False,t3_b7ealw,1,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b7ealw/us_stocks_rise_notching_best_quarter_since_the/,14,,U.S. Stocks Rise Notching Best Quarter Since the Crisis,14,https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-rise-as-u-s-china-trade-talks-resume-11553850309

This comment seems like a major case of Islamaphobia to meSarcasm Up to 615 dead now looking at link It updates every day. I hadn't heard about any islamist attacks this is insane. What I find interesting about this is that the majority are Sunni Wahhabi/salafi extremist.This is all modern Saudi ideology at work. What a relief I’m American and thank God I’m Texan. But someone should do something about that over there... where’s the pope at? We need the Templar knights!!! We need the Templar knights!!!They had a setback after Desmond Miles passed away Wasn't that a benefit to the Templars since he was in opposition to them? Vidic's death was the setback. Sort of Vidic was the prominent scientist.Desmond however had the lineage that held the power the Templars wished for. Yeah but they got his genetic information they needed after he sacrificed himself. The pope is afraid of someone kissing his ring he ain’t gonna declare a crusade.On the off chance he does I’ll be the first to sign up. Look I get the point but in general nobody (the media) cares what happens outside of first world or western countries. They're not covering lgbt folk getting killed in large numbers in the middle east and such either.Really outside of palestine nobody seems to care I think. Controversial opinion: People only care about Palestine because Palestine is fighting The Jews™. Some closer to the fringes probably. I think it's because israel is first world surrounded by third and second world countries. Palestine makes for an attractive underdog story to some left wingers. The Lord my GOD does Well yeah bc if you say anything you're racist For the sake of accuracy this violence isn't motivated by religion. It's about grazing rights.The herdsman happen to be Muslim while the farmers happen to be Christian.The attacks are not due to religious differences. I posted this same idea last time this was posted and got obliviated**...** Probably because it's totally inaccurate. Hey. Im cool with being wrong if there is contradicting information.But this conflict has been going on for a long for a while and it seems to stem from gazing rights.There are many other cases where the motivations are based on religion.But once facts are manufactured by a group to serve a political objective that group loses credibility.

ReaganTroll,Democrats are struggling over the direction of their party and this week things got more complicated. In addition to the splits over the Green Leap Forward Medicare for All and constitutional rewrites Robert Mueller’s report has opened a new divide. It’s Team Reality vs. Team Bitter Enders.Granted the end of the special counsel’s probe is a shattering blow to Trump haters. So long as Mr. Mueller continued his investigation the left and its media mates were free to spin collusion claims and nurse hopes of a toppled Trump presidency. Anyone who pushed back was told to sit down shut up and wait until Mr. Mueller ruled. He now has. The party is over.Realists understand the risks of continuing to dwell on collusion and obstruction of justice. Americans are weary of Mueller headlines. In a CNN poll this month respondents listed the economy immigration and health care as their most important issues for 2020. No one listed the special-counsel probe. The Democrats who are actually charged with electing more Democrats understand this. In a leadership meeting Monday night Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee laid out the alarming reality: Voters have little idea what the Democratic policy agenda is; the party urgently needs to move beyond 2016.The realists also understand the Mueller probe has gained the party little up to now beyond gratifying its base. While the resistance wallowed in collusion hysteria Donald Trump presided over tax reform massive deregulation and a remake of significant parts of the judiciary. He’s an incumbent presiding over a growing economy with a campaign awash in money. A Politico story recently warned the left not to put much stock in approval ratings: “If the election were held today” the reporters wrote Mr. Trump would “likely ride to a second term in a huge landslide according to multiple economic models with strong track records of picking presidential winners and losses.”This is why Speaker Nancy Pelosi derided impeachment as “not worth it.” And it’s why she held another closed-door caucus meeting Tuesday lecturing members on the need to stay focused on issues that helped Democrats in 2018. Her deputies at least got the message. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries didn’t even mention Mr. Mueller in his opening statement in an ensuing press conference. Majority Whip James Clyburn declared the Mueller chapter “closed.”But the Bitter Enders are having none of it. Liberal pundits and TV hosts now accuse Attorney General Bill Barr of a “coverup” and meditate on the cosmic meaning of “exoneration.” Former FBI Director James Comey claimed on NBC that the Mueller report was deficient. Liberal legal analysts explained that Mr. Trump is still guilty of all kinds of counterintelligence sins outside Mr. Mueller’s jurisdiction.Mrs. Pelosi’s bigger problem is her members. Michigan’s Rashida Tlaib responded to the Mueller report by introducing a resolution for impeachment. California’s Eric Swalwell went on air to insist—no kidding—that the debunked Steele dossier was “factual.” Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff—in response to a call by every committee Republican for his resignation—doubled down on his irresponsible claims arguing that there is clear “evidence” of collusion.It would be one thing if the Bitter Enders were few or marginalized. But they make up a significant portion of the Democratic House majority. Hailing primarily from liberal districts they need to worry not as much about re-election as about furious progressive activists who for two years were promised conspiracy obstruction and impeachment and still demand it. The presidential candidates have a similar interest in whipping up those crowds with Trump-collusion talk.Mr. Schiff meanwhile holds a powerful post drives headlines and has a reputational interest in carrying on. Chairmen Elijah Cummings and Jerry Nadler of the Oversight and Judiciary committees respectively are attempting to pursue broader investigations—of Trump finances or supposed corruption. But one interesting legacy of the Mueller probe is that any investigation into Mr. Trump—no matter what the topic—may come across as more of the same. And Mrs. Pelosi has little ability to rein in these senior members.Finally there’s the media which—after a humiliating week—has a self-interest in giving airtime to those who would diminish its atrocious performance. Mrs. Pelosi tried to change the subject this week to health care. A few reporters bit but most of the headlines are still about Mr. Mueller. And think of all the forthcoming news hooks—the release of the report itself the inspector general findings the Senate Judiciary Committee investigation.The question for reality-minded Democrats is how they put the Russia genie back in the bottle. It was supposed to spell the end of Mr. Trump. If they play their cards wrong it could help him to re-election.,0,False,t3_b7e816,1,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b7e816/the_mueller_bitter_enders/,11,,The Mueller Bitter Enders,11,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mueller-bitter-enders-11553815242

When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves they lose once and for all their sense of probity.

hellodark10,"Not surprising.  My wife is a legal immigrant she has done a 180 and is all in for Trump.  She is as supportive of the wall or even more so than anyone I know. Out of curiosity what turned her around? The truth turned her around.  She has been in America for almost 3 years now. We went through the long expensive hassle of doing this legally. I think in her old country she was getting all her news from CNN and Facebook  and one day she asked me why Trump was closing down America not letting anybody in . I explained to her about the caravan and who is coming in how they're gonna get all the things that she was not allowed to have.  she was like screw that build the wall and electrify it LOLwhen she got here she did not like Bush because Bush loved war and she liked Obama because Obama was going to end war.  She also hated guns now she loves them . when we went back to Indonesia last summer to visit her family everybody asked her what it was like living in America under Trump.  she told everyone it was fine he had almost no effect on our lives If election were held today I believe Trump would win. Unfortunately as election gets closer more false flags and craziness will go on to swing that election then probably ever in our countries history. Our biggest risk factor is the potential for a recession at a horrible time.  We've gone so many years since the last recession it's inevitably soon (1-3 years). and/or higher oil prices which have been low for 5 yearswell he's probably not going to lose solely on the basis of $5 gasoline but it wouldn't help If gas hits $5 a gallon he ain’t winning. Even if it wasn’t his administration’s fault it would 150% be attributed to him somehow. It’ll be interesting to see who the Democrats pick. Not Biden. That’s for sure. Second time I've seen this recently from two different polling orgs. Must be something to it. Other one was Rasmussen IIRC.I've always said that one of the biggest lies out there in politics is that you win with Hispanics by being amenable to illegal immigration. Truth is they are very divided on that issue. Once that hits 51% Nancy Pelosi will grab a shovel and go build the wall herself.

Yes I have fellow conservative.   However  have you considered Orange Man Bad? You can be a conservative and not like Trump. Totally agree. However realistically the alternatives are far more scary so I hope conservatives really behind him even if they have to hold their nose. I truly worry that the next time the dems hold congress and the presidency it will be the beginning of the end for representative democracy in America. They have accelerated their agenda like crazy. I completely agree.   However  we all have post histories.   I encourage you to look at his.   He's not a conservative. In the interest of cordial debate what exactly makes you so worked up? Personally I view President Trump as his own Zaphod Beeblebrox- he is flashy and loud and outrageous which distracts many people from his policies and administration. The policies themselves have been in my opinion generally good. Greetings fellow conservative. Trump is bad! Immigration is good. Welfare is good.

xFYD_,I don’t know why it’s so hard to understand that coming into another country illegally is illegal. It makes you a criminal. Full stop. Being against illegal immigration makes you a white nationalist according to Omar. There’s nothing inherently racist about wanting people to obey the law. I understand there’s a ton of baggage associated with this subject and there may be some valid arguments for and against the way out Federal Govt. handles and processes illegals...but at the end of the day they are criminals who have broken the law of our country and need to be dealt with like criminals.Would it be Black Nationalist if the government of Kenya were to detain people for entering their country illegally? No not at all. They are simply protecting their sovereignty by enforcing their laws.Race has fuck-all to do with it. Full stop. Race has all to do with it in their minds. We could deport a group of white blonde haired immigrants and in their mind it's a family of Mexicans being sent to the gas chambers. It's not logic based. It’s just such a non-sequitur. If we extend the logic of not enforcing our laws and facilitating criminal behavior in the name of political correctness...then murder robbery and rape all become fair game. Sigh. Ah ah ah - no Straw Manning.Do I say anything anywhere about doing anything to anyone?Or instead did I make a statement about the legality of entering a sovereign nation without permission? You just pointed to another part of the article as if I were referencing it. I didn’t. And I’m not.When you present some argument and point to it as if it’s an argument I made and then demand I defend them that’s the definition of Straw Manning. You’re literally putting words in my mouth.Do you have a valid argument against my actual statement that coming into a country illegally is illegal and it makes you a criminal?As an American I can’t just enter Germany without going through the proper channels and if I do it’s illegal and I’m a criminal. I’ve broken the laws of a sovereign nation. So do you still have a problem with my original statement? Your statement was both factual and random. Not bad for a Russian bot huh? I never would have guessed She’s just saying they should be treated more humanelyHere's an idea: how about immediate deportation for all that are caught....to Bir Tawil.  Not owned by anyone so no one can complain about them being sent there - and it will take them a while to get back if they want to try again.Then there's no inhumane treatment and in fact no treatment at all for longer than it takes to remove them. Vacant thoughts indeed. Maybe next time comment on the posted article instead of adding a random comment.  Racism is a bad thing to support. So now you’re accusing me of supporting racism?If that’s the case then you’re also explicitly supporting racism yourself as you’ve already agreed to my initial comment which l’ll gently remind you again was that entering a country illegally is illegal and makes the person committing the act a criminal.Still not sure how this objective statement qualifies as racist. I didn’t accuse you of racism.  I just said it was a bad thing to support.  Do you disagree?See how hard it is to have a discussion with  someone who is posting comments that arent related to the topic at hand? Yeaaah... #notmyrepresentative.

I'm actually convinced she's the product of excess chromosomes Don’t you mean the justice democrats? Yes. Thank you for correcting me You’re welcome.

tehForce,AmenUnfortunately it doesn’t seem to be getting much respect as of late Gerrymandering deserves a lot of respect too The system most certainly does not so sure about the college itself however. It’s as if preventing mob rule is important. Its ironic that the Left uses the last POTUS election as evidence to abolish the EC when they ironically proved its perpetual value.  Here is how....The Left says that every vote counts.  That is their justification for saying that the popular vote should be the deciding factor.But in this last election Debbie Wasserman Shultz and the DNC hand selected the Democratic candidate. We literally had people in a back room deciding the major candidate.  Then they destroyed the evidence bleached her hard drive and she sent her IT guy out if the country.  All of this was part of the orchestration of defrauding Bernie Sanders supporters and stealing that nomination.Onto the general election where the “Blue Wall” is a real obstacle to any competitor to a Democrat.  With CA and NY already in their perpetual grasp Democrats enter the race with a substantive lead in electoral votes.  Th Dem candidate can focus on the battleground states instead.  This is a big campaigning advantage.   Hillary chose not to do that failing to campaign heavily (or at all) in those states. I guess the Russians made her do that.   But with a good strategy an opponent can win as Trump proved.  The EC system forces candidates to go to many states and earn those votes.Imagine a general election 20 years from now if Dems get their way.  This desire shows their interest is only in power and not the good of the country.Before moving on I urge you to google “popular vote by county 2016”.   It’s illuminating. You see the distribution of Democratic and Republican counties in that election.   But this also reveals where to campaign in the future.In a popular vote scenario the Democratic hand selected candidate would only need to go to dense population centers in those counties they won last election.  They can ignore the rest of the state  and just  campaign in the dense locations.    This system gives an insurmountable advantage to Dems.   They can focus exclusively on very few areas.  This allows Dems to save money and time by limiting their appearances while an opponent has to travel all over the state to gain votes (due to the lower population density of those counties)and all over the country to pick up popular votes.With a popular vote system in effect the Democrats would put forward their hand selected candidate who would campaign in only densely populated locations in certain states.  (Do you think a Democrat would bother even going to the Midwest after looking at that map? )Most of the country would never see them and never challenge their positions or ideas.  It would be a coronation every election of the people the DNC handpick in their back rooms.   In effect people’s votes outside those densely populated cities would be irrelevant and they would stop voting altogether in time.This system would eventually be contrary to the Democrat’s stated position that every vote counts but since it would assure them power they wouldn’t care. The perfect dictatorship That’s what they want so long as they are the ones in power. Can people please stop looking up to Hamilton? He's the man who started the entire mess in the US. Hamilton was the worst founding father.I’m glad his bank died.

Since her crime also involves unethical legal behavior she should also lose her legal license. The NYT Daily podcast just did a 30 min episode about the R. Kelly case. Coincidentally Kim Foxx was also a minor part of the first prosecution of R Kelly. The first 15 min if the podcast was a glowing biography of Kim and how she is tough and fighting crime. It came out 2 days after her name hit the papers in the Smollett coincidence I think not. The NYT again running cover for the corrupt Dems and misdirecting like the propaganda they are. Can I get a TL;DR?  Tribune is apparently blocked in the UK. ook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx probably will and arguably should lose her job next year over her office’s handling of the Jussie Smollett case.Yes there are many worse crimes committed every day in Chicago than staging a hate-inspired attack and filing a false police report about it — the offense with which Smollett was charged. And no justice did not demand that Smollett be shackled and shipped off to prison for allegedly orchestrating a stunt.But justice demanded resolution and accountability. And Foxx appeared oblivious to this imperative as she made the media rounds attempting to explain why her office sent Smollett on his merry way Tuesday morning without extracting an admission of guilt or collecting a meaningful fine.Her tone-deaf statements included equating Smollett to the raft of no-name low-level nonviolent offenders who have received the “go and sin no more” treatment and patronizing those who are outraged by the outcome as “people who don’t understand the intricacies of the justice system.”Here’s what we understand: High-profile criminal cases are the lens through which the public sees and evaluates the administration of justice as a whole.Is the alleged crime investigated thoroughly and honestly? Is the process of obtaining an outcome transparent and fair? Does the result give us confidence that all the low-profile cases most of us never hear of are being handled with integrity?Smollett’s claim was high-profile because he’s a celebrity — a star of TV’s “Empire” — and because he alleged that his attackers evoked President Donald Trump used racial and homophobic slurs and deployed a noose in giving him a light beating on a Streeterville sidewalk in the wee hours of Jan. 29.The claim got national attention and put pressure on the Chicago Police Department to track down the perpetrators or else risk looking indifferent to a disturbing battery against a prominent African-American gay man.And when Smollett’s claim unraveled and authorities alleged he and two acquaintances had faked the whole thing the pressure shifted onto the Cook County state’s attorney’s office. Foxx and her team had to demonstrate that they take seriously the social damage caused by invented hate crimes particularly ones that command significant investigatory resources.It was a fairly basic task. They failed spectacularly.The process that brought a surprise end to the case was anything but transparent. Prosecutors didn’t even alert reporters to the “emergency” hearing where they dropped without explanation all 16 felony disorderly conduct charges and where they didn’t object to the sealing of the court file.And although prosecutors got Smollett to forfeit his bond of $10000 — not much of a dent in the budget of an actor who reportedly makes more than 10 times that amount per episode of “Empire” — they did not even ask for a confession or apology.That allowed Smollett to repair immediately to the courthouse lobby and preen for the cameras about his innocence.His lawyers have since repeatedly echoed this claim for example responding Thursday to the city’s demand that Smollett pay the cost of the investigation later estimated at $130000 with a statement saying “It is the mayor and the police chief who owe Jussie — owe him an apology — for dragging an innocent man’s character through the mud. Jussie has paid enough.”Such galling pieties have infuriated all of us who wanted to see the accused selfish charlatan humbled and fined for allegedly perpetrating such an ugly hoax.Had the case against him fallen apart? That would have been a passable explanation given that witnesses do disappear or change their stories. But no prosecutors expressed continued confidence in their ability to have proved Smollett guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.Had prosecutors told themselves that a blindsided public would be satisfied by the “Oh we do this a lot” explanation of an abrupt dismissal of charges in a sensational case? Not unless they’re extremely dense.Foxx could have distanced herself from this blunder given that her own blunder — emailing and texting with people close to Smollett early in the investigation — had prompted her to step away from the case and leave it to underlings. But she grabbed ownership of it Wednesday giving interviews in which she expressed pride and confidence in the way her office had handled the case.And although she can point with some pride to the diversionary programs that have kept small-time offenders out of jail and offered them fresh starts and clean states her betrayal of the public’s understandable expectations of justice in the Smollett case will taint that entire initiative. Both the National District Attorneys Association and the Illinois Prosecutors Bar Association have released statements this week sharply critical of Foxx.She will be defending this deeply disappointing outcome from now until at least March 17 2020. That’s the date of the primary election in which she is now certain to face a Democratic challenger for the office whose ideals she has disgraced. I hope the bar association takes her to task. This seems like an absolute abuse of power and I’d hate to see the precedent of a two-tiered justice system continued.  Thanks for the summary! TL:DR - Kim Foxx is a corrupt state attorney who dropped 16 felony charges and sealed the court documents. The city and police are pissed off and billing Jussie for wasting their time. The Author of the opinion article thinks Kim Foxx will be investigated and fired. Tribune is apparently blocked in the UK.Not that you're missing much...but what the actual fuck? A random news source is blocked in the UK? Why? No clue.

It didn’t happen that way.In fact Gingrich the presidential candidate and former House speaker and his first wife Jackie Battley had already separated before she was hospitalized. He had filed for divorce and she was seeking alimony and custody of their two children.

chabanais,"""Let me tell you why this is actually bad."" - CNN Or they are also gonna say “This is actually because of Obama’s presidency not trump’s” Nah we’re closer to the next election now than the last. They will say “The record GDP growth is in anticipation of Joe Biden being elected”. The markets are reacting to President Kamala Harris' incredible new future economic policies. Molestin’ Biden not getting elected to anything But Joe Biden is cool with us young people! All my liberal friends think he is one of the coolest Vice Presidents ever because he was a VP of our first black president! He gets and understands us fellow kids! You do know that our president admitted to molesting women in an interview right? No idea what you’re talking about They sure in the hell well. Just watch. “Beginning of the end” CNN had an article yesterday explaining why ice growth on a glacier was bad...If ice melts it's bad if ice grows it's bad...https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/27/world/climate-change-greenland-glacier-growing-wxc-trnd/index.html They’ll probably point to the kind of concerns listed here. http://www.crfb.org/blogs/deficit-has-never-been-high-when-economy-was-strong You’d think this would matter but it will be completely ignored by the MSM and when brought to the attention of the die hards they’ll proudly proclaim that “Obama was dealing with the repercussions of Bush” and “Trump is benefiting from Obama”.You can lead a horse to water but you cannot force it to take a drink. Exactly. But I've seen like 10 posts in the last two days about releasing trumps financials and then another 20 about releasing the Mueller report. And all the MSM is emphasizing is “it does not exonerate him” because the left no longer cares about little inconveniences like due process justice or how impossible it is to prove a negative.Just outrage and the complete absence of logic and critical thinking. What does GDP mean for the average person though?Real wage growth is nominal so even if the value of goods and services are increasing (which is great) that’s not being reflected by the quality of life for most Americans.Some estimates are expecting a bump in real wage growth for this year but until that happens I don’t see a reason to get excited about the GDP. Wage growth is the best its been in decades although still not good enough. Cost of living has been rising with it though. Also growth in past months are constantly being revised down making it easier to say that there’s been growth. I kinda like Trump but I think he’s messed himself up by not dealing with the core problems we had with Obama’s economy. The cost of living was going to rise regardless. Inflation and cost of living increases have actually been remarkabley low. Inflation is also much lower than anticipated. But wages haven't kept up with either in decades. If you have a balanced 401k indirectly you would most likely benefit Anyone with a 401k invested in US stocks has benefited. According to the left only rich elites put money into their 401k’s though so I guess no regular people are benefitting. /s",0,False,t3_b6y9cw,87,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b6y9cw/its_official_us_is_first_country_in_world_history/,769,,It's Official: US is First Country in World History to Increase GDP by More than $1 Trillion in a Year!,769,https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/03/its-official-us-is-first-country-in-world-history-to-increase-gdp-by-more-than-1-trillion-in-a-year/

I think it's you man. It might be because I'm on mobile idk Nothing new there.  The Soviets were (in)famous for removing people from history if they didn't match the current government line.  They went as far as altering photos to remove people. Let's be honest guys they want the full report so they can magnify petty offenses and there will be some things in there that are morally questionable even if not illegal. They're going to have a field day with the full report by blowing up small things and with the help of a media machine in damage control mode they will try to completely change the narrative. They might be successful in doing so again with the help of the media. The media took a pretty hard hit on the Mueller report producing nothing and they'd love nothing more than some (imagined) vindication. Release it then. Shouldn’t we all want as much of the report public as possible for simple transparency?Also if there are illegal actives possible felonies shouldn’t we know about those so we can ask if those pass as High Crimes or Misdemeanors? Should every new president have a multi- year thorough investigation of his campaign and his associates where even if no crimes are uncovered an exhastive report of their private conduct is made public? I can see how some would support that but I think it would have an exceptionally chilling effect on democracy. So your response to the proven criminality of Trump’s inner circle is to go whatabout all over the place for obama’s imagined crimes? Do you really think the GOP wouldn’t have done this if Obama had a shred of evidence similar to what Mueller’s investigation already turned up? Keep dreaming Mueller didn't have a shred of evidence you jackass. That's why not a single American citizen was indicted for crimes related to conspiring with Russia. possible feloniesYeah. I'm sure Barr decided not to summarize impeachable offenses in a report he has to make public after grand jury redactions. Makes a ton of sense. In a vacuum transparency is good. Conservatives as a whole are just tired of the goalposts moving when things don't go the Democrats way. Release the whole thing unredacted for all I care but there is zero doubt in my mind that if it's nothing (as Mueller and Barr summaries indicate) that Democrats will either magnify petty infractions or question the integrity of the investigation itself. This will lead to further investigation at which point possibly well-meaning people like you can say things like ""Isn't it a good thing to confirm the investigation was thorough?""In a vacuum good. But Democrats are chasing a conclusion and won't stop investigating until they find evidence to support it even if it doesn't exist. I am just someone who supports transparency in the government. I think that is a very popular ideal from Americans. When has government transparency been an ideal of the left?? Almost every conservative I know has always wanted greater transparency in government regardless of who is sitting at the table so that citizens can be informed of government action or inaction.Not that I would say the democrats/liberals wants to operate in complete secrecy but I’ve generally noticed that federal transparency is less important to democrats in favor of a more “need-to-know” basis (just my anecdotal experience). Which had a lot to do with both of the Clinton’s downfalls.Seriously though when did that change? Are conservatives now in favor of less transparency for the people to form their own opinion? Essentially having someone provide them information based on the narrative of whoever is sitting at the desk. No thanks man I’d rather have the redacted report instead of someone’s personal summarization of the report. Also before someone says it yes I know certain things need to be blinded to protect future legal proceedings but it should be released as soon as humanly possible.Not to mention when has illegal or unethical acts in government been something conservatives are okay with? Those are things that should be known and talked about. Sure I agree petty political bullshit isn’t important but if my congressman is doing something illegal or unethical I damn well want to know about it. It troubles me that some of the conservatives in this thread are now “okay” with leadership performing illegal or unethical actions just because democrats are going to “magnify” it. We literally did the exact same thing when Obama was president and quite a bit of it was justified but not every issue was “illegal” yet it was still discussed and criticized. How can we honestly say that in 2019 people shouldn’t be questioning those types of borderline illegal and/or unethical actions. Oh please wanting ""transparency"" about a report (which is already going to come out) so you can nitpick nonsense isn't a real ""we want transparency"" movement it's just the latest rewording of orange man bad.It troubles me that some of the conservatives in this thread are now “okay” with leadership performing illegal or unethical actions just because democrats are going to “magnify” itNobody here is saying this.

ReaganTroll,WASHINGTON—Utah will be able to limit its expansion of Medicaid under a decision from the Trump administration that falls short of a broadening of eligibility that the state’s voters had approved last year.Voters in the November midterm elections had approved a full expansion under the Affordable Care Act that was projected to result in more than 120000 people gaining coverage.But state lawmakers in the Republican-led legislature asked the federal government to let Utah pursue a more scaled-back expansion that would cover an estimated 50000 fewer people.The program approved Friday by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will serve as a bridge for one year when the federal government could increase its share of costs for the expansion per request from the state. Utah also got approval to impose work requirements but state officials said that won’t begin until 2020.Utah is also the first state to get approval to cap enrollment if there are insufficient state funds available to match the federal funds.For the first year of the program’s expansion which starts April 1 the federal government will cover about 70% of the cost; Utah will cover the remaining 30% state officials said.If the Trump administration lets the state keep its partial expansion but increases its share of the cost to 90% which Utah officials have requested it could be significant. Other Republican-led states that haven’t increased their Medicaid program under the ACA may then also pursue a partial expansion with the more robust federal funding. Some state officials have said that would be less of a financial burden than a full expansion.Alternatively states with a full expansion could also seek to pare it back. The state-federal program for the low income and the disabled has swelled under the ACA with 37 states and Washington D.C. having expanded Medicaid.Supporters of the November referendum to expand Medicaid in Utah had criticized the legislature’s decision to seek only the partial expansion.“The legislature is trampling on the clear will of the voters and it’s stripping tens of thousands of Utahns of access to care in the process” Jonathan Schleifer executive director of the Fairness Project said in late February. The organization finances and supports Medicaid expansion efforts in states.Medicaid expansion under the ACA has turned into a fierce battle as GOP-led states get first-ever approvals for limits on the program from the Trump administration which recently saw a major set back in its backing of such restrictions. A federal judge on Wednesday invalidated Medicaid work requirements in Arkansas and Kentucky dealing a blow to the Trump administration’s attempts to remold the safety-net health program.The decision blocked Arkansas from continuing to enforce its work requirement which has resulted in 18000 residents there falling off Medicaid rolls since the state implemented the work mandates in June. It also prevents Kentucky’s work requirement from taking effect which it was set to do on April 1.Critics say work requirements and enrollment caps on Medicaid expansion are part of a Republican effort to limit or take away coverage. Supporters argue that the requirements which often permit beneficiaries to do community service or schooling instead of work help people become employed where they can obtain health coverage on the job.“It isn’t easy to design a program that cares for the whole needs of a person including the social determinants that we know have such a large impact on health like work and community engagement” said CMS Administrator Seema Verma.

Aodhan88,"It is interesting seeing how divided Chicago is becoming over this.  I wonder the long term effects this will have. Can Chicago get any more polarized? between the racial tension and the vortexes you'd think they'd have maxed out Maybe there will be a burgeoning conservative movement. I expect they will just all shoot each other. I actually think this is a rare moment of unity in Chicago. Everyone pretty much uniformly hates this guy and the circumstances. Not black people Tribalism needs to go. Same He's definitely not out of trouble yet. Even if he gets off on the charges by local law enforcement he still has the feds after him. That's never going to end well for you. Mail fraud is no joke. Making a fake terrorist threat while committing mail fraud is even less of a jokeSmollett's family seems to have connections from on high though considering he got off with bond forfeiture and community service as time served in Chicago. Record expunged. No remorse. Privilege indeed. We'll see how this goes with the feds yeah if you mail a terrorist threat it had better not be fraudulent Hopefully the feds can clear up this soup sandwich. If they find him guilty of sending that letter to himself then that proves that the Chicago trial would have ended in a guilty verdict which would mean he isn’t innocent like he’s claiming to be. This makes me so happy.I see it as if he pays this it is basically an admission of guilt.  Which is what makes me upset about the whole thing.  I wouldn't care if he got a plea deal and 16 hours of community service and surrendering his $10000 was the deal.  It is what I expect from someone who can afford good lawyers.  What makes me upset is that he didn't admit he was guilty and has the arrogance to say that he never lied.  Your accomplices gave you up they said you paid them to do it what more evidence would anyone need to convict?  Then to say the Mayor and CPD need to apologize to you...Any lawyers care to chime in on this?  I am curious if the CPD pursued this they would being required to prove it was a false report right?  So we would get to see all the evidence (maybe not us but a judge)?  What are the chances we would get closure if he decides not to pay this? Then to say the Mayor and CPD need to apologize to you...Yeah the doubling down is pretty wild.  I wouldn't expect him to apologize but holy shit he would be better served by keeping his mouth shut. I think you misunderstood.  Smollett wants Chicago Mayor and PD to apologize to him!https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Official-Chicago-is-Seeking-130K-from-Smollett-507795391.htmlA representative for Smollett's legal team said ""it is the mayor and the police chief who owe Jussie - owe him an apology - for dragging an innocent man’s character through the mud. Jussie has paid enough.""  Oh no I understand!  I'm just saying it's insane for him to expect them to apologize.  If I were him I would shut the fuck up and keep my head down! he said he isn't going to pay it. he had the nerve to say that the chicago PD owe him an apology They had a signed personal check AND footage of him with the two brothers a bit before the attack. It is so galling that guy coming out and acting like he is as white as the snow and it is just a conspiracy by the Chicago PD. Isnt this just kinda buying your way out of jail time? Won’t happen.  How can someone be held financially responsible when charges were eventually dropped? Fuckin lock his ass up. The penalty for false accusation should be AT LEAST the penalty for being found guilty of said accusation. In this case - charge his lying ass with a couple hate crimes and send him upriver. If the charges were dropped how can they possibly order that he pay this?

xFYD_,"Its FUCKING RAW! ""This beef is so raw it could pass out at a 911 memorial!"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCujO6Ujw_o omg thank you for this. Lol thank the OP -- he reminded me of it! For years just thinking of slo-mo Gordon going ""theeeee bassss is fookin rawwwwW"" would cause me to breakout into random laughter. oh dude this is the best.  I cant get over how well its done.  I don't even know why its funny but i cant stop laughing at it. There's something about the slo-mo and the fact it makes Ramsay appear more emotional almost-crying really kills me. And some Risotto. Nice simple fresh. Then there's a good chance that when he's ready to retire his kids will be able to carry on the family business. Honestly with that much going for them they will be unstoppable.  The sun will never set on the Ramsay Empire. I wonder what kind of chores those kids have to do to make so much a week.As much as I don't really appreciate Ramsay's career he seems like he understands the point of parenting (turning kids into functional adults) a lot better than some people. He built himself from nothing.  I believe he was also in jail at one point.  He got to where he is on hard work. You can tell this by the way he interacts with the people he tries to help on his shows. There are times when he’ll go to those restaurants and rip the owners and employees a new one (whoever deserves it anyways) and then later comes in with a kind hearted approach. Though when it comes back to the kitchen work to see how everyone progressed he’s back to taking it serious again like he normally does. Such a cool dudeI like to think that’s all real anyways haha From what I've heard that kinda is. I've heard stories of people meeting him on set then later meeting him again a few months or years later and him still remembering them and carrying on where they left off.You can tell the impact he has on people by the way the successful restaurants treat him. There was one episode of kitchen nightmares where it was these two brothers who had a pretty nasty pizza shop. They were acting like children and Ramsey put them into place and got them acting like owners of a restaurant. He came back for a return visit a few years later and the brothers started crying when they saw him they were so happy. He had whipped them into shape and gave them the tough love they needed. They said that with every decision or food they sent out they would think ""would Ramsay send that out?"".He is a tough SOB no doubt about that I think he kinda kicks it into gear for the cameras (kinda like Trump a bit) but that toughness is a standard that he hold himself and everyone else to. His personality comes out a bit better with kids. I think he really deserves the respect and accolades he gets. Kid does literally anything:Gordon Ramsay: ""You're not even trying you fucking Donkey!"" He’s actually not that bad to kids he’s firm but not insulting like he is to adults that should do better I was a little surprised when I saw him on a cooking show my kids were watching (Masterchef Jr).  Turns out he's pretty supportive.  Still calls the kids out on mistakes but usually turns it into a teaching moment.  Not sure if it was staged or not but he came across like a good guy. What's staged is him being an asshole to the adults. Watch him on non-American shows and he's nice and trying to teach people stuff. Yeah the difference between the US and UK versions of Kitchen Nightmares is night and day. Don’t get me wrong I laugh as much as anyone when he curses out an incompetent chef or owner in the US one but the focus is entirely different. The UK version spent way more time on him building a rapport with the staff and teaching them. The US version spends half an hour on “look at what a disaster this kitchen/dining area/owner’s family is! LOL” We can see the entitled generation already taking hold. These people are becoming Democrat politicians who throw a fit when they lose elections and concoct schemes to reverse the results in their favor. Sometimes I question if I’m arguing a child or a grown 40 year old on r/politics I respect him and yeah I bet they’re not being as spoiled as they could be.Then again why is he still giving a 17yo (let alone 21yo) an allowance meh. Set incentives based on performance. Kid learns incentive structures. Get old and die. Kid still knows incentive structures and hopefully has learned skills to be successful in life.$130 per week isn't crazy as a stipend for a 21 year old in college. Enough to make sure they aren't exclusively eating ramen but not enough to totally spoil the kid.Damn. I knew a guy getting around $1k a month in college. That was basically just spending money for him. That wasn't including his rent or tuition (which his parents paid as well).I knew some girls too that just had credit cards which were seemingly bottomless. Didn't ask too many questions about that. Fair enough but I knew no one like that.

What's their shit about? Thank the FSM I never bought their over-priced crap anyway. Is Dicks even big enough to be news anymore??? Its now just a mediocre strip-mall anchor store. They should fire their CEO. If they hate guns and the 2A they should have just stated that it’s not profitable and removed all guns and accessories instead of alienating half of their potential customer base. Then they would have lost the opportunity to virtue signal.  They just made a mistake in calculation on how much of their customer base would leave vs. how many leftists their virtue signaling would attract. That’s true.

brad1098,"Biden is totally a sexual Predator and its scary the mainstream media doesn't acknowledge it Where you been? Bill Clinton is a rapist. True i shouldn't expect much Apparently he’s no longer useful to them so he’s probably on the way out. He is too white and too male to run for president as a Democrat. Media is turning on him because he isn't diverse enough. Robert O'Rourke is going through the same He also defended segregation.  That will be the nail in his campaign coffin if nothing else gets him first. Believe all women.Believe victimsWait how CNN and MSNBC hides this!?Jokes apart: we should stand on our ground. We should assume Joe Biden is innocent unless the accuser brings evidence? Though Joe is a touchy type of person We should not jump to conclusions. That would attract more people to our side than jumping on this story But we know he's done this before. There's many videos of it. Isn't it possible that he made those other women and girls he did stuff like that to just as uncomfortable as this woman claims to have been? #theyknew I don't see Joe touching other men as much as he touches women and young girls.  It couldn't be more obvious that this guy is a weirdo and a potential predator. That's just Joe being joe Wait Joe from the sandwich shop down the road? Middle class joe It's all over YouTube.

Creepy uncle joe back up to his old nonsense.Classic uncle joe As much as I want to rub it in Biden's face  I need to be consistent and ask where is the evidence? On YouTube.  It's disturbing.  He probably emotionally scarred a couple of young ladies for life. I don't doubt it but that is not the standard of evidence in a courtroom. We need to presume innocent until guilty and until then I will not make judgment on Joe Biden as creepy as he appears Exactly what sort of evidence are you looking for if video evidence doesn't cut it?

thatrightwinger,Here is what's wonderful.Everything the dems have tried since 2016 has backfired. Trump's popularity have never been higher.The more they go after Trump and the less they actually develop a platform for 2020.The better. Unless Trump keeps pushing for his entirely mystifying total repeal of Obamacare given that health care let the Democrats take control of the House in 2016. *2018 yes I am still amazed how many seats they needed and how many seats they got.  But so far what possibly has the house done so far.  Where are the articles of impeachment I heard so much about. You mean the issue they forgot about by mid-November? I never said it was genuine; I simply said that it got them election results. I wish that they would repeal Obamacare but I don't see how it can go anywhere with the dems in control of the house for the next few years.Politicians repubs included love to pick fights that they can not win just so they can spend all of their time acting like they're doing something without having to do anything at all.If a health care bill actually gets passed before 2021 with bipartisan support from both the repubs and the democrats it is going to be more of the same bloated ineffectual garbage that we have now. I always hated freshmen. Sounds like “Ms. [Insert Teacher Name Here.] Donny did something but I don’t know what! Give him detention!” How about we investigate Jussie Smollett instead?

I know the answer to the question the book posed without my even having to open it. People still believe in the wage gap myth? It's like believing that world is flat at this point People do that too haha. I still maintain that flat earthers are just deep cover trolls that never break character and are having a joke at everyone's expense Dude. The moon is a hologram made of cheese. Get over it. roundy frankly I enjoy conspiracy theories if nobody in the room is taking them super seriously. A good conspiracy theory is like this great work of fiction you can create to explain natural phenomena The wage gap myth has been debunked since at least the early 1980s (Sowell on Firing Line).Lefties aren't just wrong they are liars who know better. Rachel madcow has had it debunked on her show numerous timesShe still peddles Which is why they're freaking out so much when Trump uses incorrect stats. ""Fuck if they start playing dirty too we're fucked."" I'm waiting for the media to ever report the truth on this. They never ever report liberal lies. They just go on for decades. Effing liar. She's a one note feminist and she's out of key. It's too big a piece of propaganda to let go and everybody who grew up defining themselves by their ""gender opression"" clings to it desperately. The most educated women I know still talk about the wage gap as though it were an article of faith that gives them purpose and meaning by fighting against the system for future women. They never would have gone for their PhDs and masters degrees if it wasn't about fighting injustice.If the gap is fictional they have literally based their lives on a lie and been played like a fiddle. A preponderance of women in power sacrificed everything they wanted for fake female justice. Thus many will cling to it to their dying breath. I'm so tired of hearing about this gender wage gap and I can't believe libs are still pushing this crap.  It does not exist.  The reason why some women get paid less than men is because they choose to go into lower paying professions.  Or they major in Feminist Transexual Gender Studies and wonder why they can't find a job at all.I'm a woman and a nurse.  I'm not paid less than my male coworkers actually I make more than a few of them.  I picked a decent paying profession.   That's like me being angry because a male doctor makes more than me.  Of course he would make more he picked a higher paying career than I did. Just an evil pitiful woman. There is actually a gap albeit an earnings gap. Earnings =/= Wages.And that Earnings Gap exists because of choices made by individuals. Some individuals choose to go into lower paying fields or stop trying to climb the success ladder to focus on things outside of work such as family friends and hobbies. Women are the majority of the population!  They are the significant majority of college graduates!  For decades they've had government-sponsored benefits for owning businesses!  Businesses aim most of their marketing to women (even generic office supply stores generally focus on women first from first-hand training experience).It's a woman's world now.

xFYD_,"She's been on the cover of Time Rolling Stones interviews all over the place on major networks.  Her tweets get more attention on Twitter than any other politician sans Trump.  She's loved by the far left millennials.  She parrots and stands for everything they believe.  Beyond that the point is she's getting plenty of air time to express her thoughts in her own words.She's underwater with pretty much everyone else who's heard of her and listened to her.  That's not a conspiracy.  That's all on her. A Person's point of reference here is important. Recently I'm a liiiitle liberal but only because I feel like the Conservative party is focused on ""winning"" more than governing at the moment as a reaction to the last president.I think she's way too far left  my more liberal family think she poops out gold and my conservative family thinks she's the next antichrist.While her existence isn't BAD per say she represents some people so it's good that conversation gets brougth up and had she's really young and it shows..... but the media fixation is going to make her the liberal version of trump (where a loud position becomes the party norm from free press coverage)I'm just left wondering when politics became sports and you had to be 100% in agreement with a party and every politician in it. Mid 30s solid conservative here (so as to give a point of reference) - really don't remember Reagan and was too young to have much of an opinion about Bush 41.  But to me things began shifting with the ""either you're with us or the terrorists"" attitude around 2004. I have to say I miss Bush and would trade today's politics for then any day but still think something shifted then. And it really grew with the identity politics of the last administration. Divide and conquer seems to have been a major tactic of President ""Community Organizer"".That's how I see it anyway but again note that my memories only go back that far. Divide and conquer seems to have been a major tactic of President ""Community Organizer"".His administration was basically Alinskyism in action The modern state of the 2 party system originated with the battle for the house with Tip O'Neil and Newt Gingrich.  Prior to the mid-90's the Dems had what was essentially a monopoly on Congress. From Wiki:The gains in seats in the mid-term election resulted in the Republicans gaining control of both the House and the Senate in January 1995. Republicans had not held the majority in the House for forty years since the 83rd Congress (elected in 1952). Republicans only controlled 4 years of both House and Senate from 1933 to 1995.Prior to this Tip ran the house like a good ole boy club.  He'd let his boys do some things and if the Republicans toted the line he'd let them play also.  Newt went around Tip and took his message to the people and really pissed Tip off.This pretty much solidified the establishment of the American political duopoly.  Both sides were polarized but both sides keep other options out.http://freakonomics.com/podcast/politics-industry/ What's worth noting is back in the 80's most voters shared about 75-80% of similar views across parties.  The left was not full of authoritarians like today and were much closer to liberal.  It was easier to agree but disagree.That did start to diverge in the 90's mostly because of the left going far far left (plenty of polls show this).  I'm not sure it was any one event or even a tit for tat back and forth where each side escalated.  It seems probable the division was happening for other reasons. For example social media/internet/like minded groups reinforcing and and radicalizing their beliefs while removing any element which required compromise by allowing people to avoid the opposite side(s).Today it's something like less than 40% of shared interests between both main parties. hey thanks for this I will read into it when i get off work. Right the supposed good old days were when Democrats had almost 60 years straight controlling Congress and there were only 3 TV stations all liberal. The reason things seemed less contentious was because one side had such an overwhelming amount of power and messaging reach.Now the Right actually has some power and can get its message out. For the first time Trump fights as hard as Leftists and I love it. You don't win a fight by pulling punches. Politics is war by other means. Getting along is nice but not at the cost of socialism. It's not even close. If the Left wants to play nice then we can talk. But I'm done with Republicans unilaterally disarming while they destroy everyone in their path. You don't win a fight by pulling punches.The glorious and always-victorious champions of the Right would disagree with you.  I have in mind Mitt Romney John McCain Ben Sasse Paul Ryan John Boehner George Will David French Jonah Goldberg and Kevin Williamson.The best way to win according to the GOP Establishment is to surrender on every single issue and take the moral high ground whenever possible.  That way the arc of history will bend towards justice or something.  /s Hahaha exactly.Some of those people don't really give a shit about fighting for our liberty. I think they believe in making themselves rich and famous and rubbing elbows with powerful people. David FrenchDavid French's entire shtick is whining about religious liberty and complaining that Trump isn't incredibly nice. Jonah Goldberg is okay sometimes and awful the other half. Kevin Williamson is an interesting writer who has ideas ranging between deranged lunatic and somewhat well thought out. We don’t need to be in lockstep agreement with a party but we do need to stand for our beliefs. That requires your beliefs to be founded in research and objectivity (or at least the attempt).Our greatest asset is an educated electorate. Indeed our future depends on it. my point being both sides claim the other side is immune to facts or logic. Facts and logic are things most people can agree on - ideology not so much. I wish. It's not nearly that simple. Both sides spread untrue things. Even more importantly the media creates narratives that lead you to the desired conclusion while technically mostly telling the truth. We're surrounded by propaganda 24/7. Almost everything you hear you're hearing it because someone with an agenda wanted you to hear it. but only because I feel like the Conservative party is focused on ""winning"" more than governing at the moment as a reaction to the last president.It's less a reaction to the last President and more a final realization that the left is not and has not been for some time actually interested in working with us to pursue a future for all Americans.  The last President certainly embodied that with Obamacare's method of passage and his ""I have a pen and I have a phone"" mentality after the rebuking of 2010.  It was the left who ushered in our era of zero-sum politics we're just starting to play by the new rules. she represents some people so it's good that conversation gets brougth upAn outright socialist who believes in banning all private businesses is not a good thing. Check the DSA's website. She's a member. To use an extreme example to illustrate my point Hitler represented some people.I want people hearing good ideas not disastrous ones. I wouldn't argue with you my case would be this is a reaction:  without seeing a reaction we can't learn from them. To put it all to rest all she needs to do is accept Ben Shapiro's offer to debate. I suggest that would put zero things to rest just like everything for the last 10 years conservatives would put up a ""sharpio pwns"" libs would put up a ""oac pwns"" 90% of people would just read the headlines and no one would change their mind at all. Shapiro would come armed with facts and proof.  AOC would come armed with ""feelings matter more than facts"".Put the whole thing up on youtube for the low information folks.  There's sure to be plenty of comedy.The truly ignorant will never change their minds but that's not what this sort of exposition is for. I dunno man the come to an interview with an open mind tactic has never worked that I've seen on either side but sure lets try it.

xFYD_,"The left has diluted alt right past tense. It literally just means Republican voter. sounds like something a 'Nazi' or an 'incel' would say. Because those too are words to describe anyone who disagrees with me. Yea ok u racistRacist: someone an uneducated liberal disagrees with That may have been sarcastic. Here is a handy chart. It also comes in far right nazi racist fascist and reactionary. Yeah by any current measure ive been alt-right since conception aimply because of my gender and skin tone This all started when our guy said Mexico is sending rapists and criminals This all started when our guy said Mexico is sending rapists and criminalsThey were and still are. It started long before any political movements gave half a shit about Donald Trump Is this surprising from the party that called everyone racist sexist homophobe islamaphope and Nazi? They wear out an ad hominem and move on to the next. Honest question: What's the next one? Seems to me after saying someone supported arguably the worst genocide in history there's not much more you can throw at them. Which ironically just means that the actual alt-right has an easier time moving around and gaining support. Wich is what dems want It is a literal smear against anyone not drinking Marx koolaid My biggest concern with this is that it takes away the language for us to condemn the actual alt-right and normal conservatives may be tricked into thinking that the alt-right is something acceptable. Meanwhile they defend antifa and the alt-left I’m with you man. I’ve seen full on alt right ideas get posted and because it gets thrown out there so much it means nothing if I call it that. I’m against ethnonationalism in the context of America because you cannot separate our history from multi ethnic society. Natives are a part because they were here first black people because of the slave trade Mexicans/PR because of Manifest Destiny/Spanish American War. It’s not an option to be a white ethnostate even if that were preferable.You can and should be able to say I want control of who comes in my country and affording those who don’t come here legally special privileges is dangerous and stupid without being called a racist but when you take that from people they’ll take even more extreme positions that are legitimately alt right. Mexicans/PR because of Manifest Destiny/Spanish American WarThere was so little Mexicans in the southwest when the US took it. It was so empty that Mexico gave land to Americans so someone would be there to stop the Apache. But then the country full of Americans wanted to go with America... I’m against ethnonationalism in the context of America because you cannot separate our history from multi ethnic society.Eh depends on how you're using ""multi-ethnic"".  Until 1965 the multi-ehnicism was exclusively European multi-ethnicism. We had populations of Puerto Rican’s Mexicans and black people by then. Not to the extent as post 1965 but we were not some sort of white ethnostate like the alt right would prescribe.Even back then it was only 85% white which wouldn’t be acceptable to a lot of white ethnostate supporting people.https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2012/11/14/u-s-racialethnic-demographics-1960-today-and-2050/comment-page-1/ A lot closer than we are now and a lot closer than you're portraying it.  That's the point - you have to change what you mean with ""multi-ethnic"" in order to get an even remotely close comparison between then and now. 85 to 47 is a big jump I won’t act like it’s not but my point we don’t have a time in our history where non-whites citizens were completely negligible populations in the United States. We’ve nearly always had at least some statistically significant population of non-white people in the US. Obviously we live in a far more racially diverse country now where white people are way less of the population and comparison of “diversity” then to now is staggering but I just don’t think we’ve ever been as white as the European countries that some white nationalist point to as an ideal composition of whites. They don't need some fancy title and frankly calling them the alt right was something we should have fought from the start. Don't call them alt right call them white supremacists or racists or bigots. We don't have to codify each special brand of bigotry. A bigot is a bigot. The problem there is that the words and phrases ""racists"" ""bigots"" &  ""white supremacists"" have already lost all meaning due to years of overuse by Leftists.",0,False,t3_b6xx8t,51,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b6xx8t/knowles_the_left_is_diluting_altright_to_mean/,312,,KNOWLES: The Left Is Diluting 'Alt-Right' To Mean Their Enemies,312,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45286/knowles-left-diluting-alt-right-mean-their-enemies-michael-j-knowles

xFYD_,Hard to do after Avenatti but I'm sure they will try. Avenatti was my immediate thought as well This isn't over yet. I predict some heads will roll and Smollett will pay a steep price of some kind anyway. I mean they’re saying Chicago will bill him ~$130000 for the cost of the investigation but even that isn’t that bad for him (comparing it to the punishment of having felonies on your record). He made something like $2250000 so that bill will be 5.7% of his annual salary. Even if you assume that he pays half of his salary in taxes that’s 11.4% of his net for committing 16 felonies.By comparison the median household income in the US is $61372.00 so if the average American were in the same situation they’d have to pay $6996.41.I don’t know about you but handing over $7k to make sure I don’t serve time I don’t have to go to trial and I don’t have to have a felony on my record (which would make it extremely difficult for him to do out of country shoots or go vacationing to tropical paradises with his friends) doesn’t really seem like that high of a price. Yeah that's true financially it won't hurt him much (although apparently the law allows for making him pay up to three times what Chicago is demanding) but it's not like he was prosecuted and acquitted. The charges were dropped so double jeopardy doesn't apply and another jurisdiction can go after him instead. Maybe the FBI for instance. When did they have a good name?

j8s8n,Glad to be an American I can't speak for the numbers in other countries but the 339 million in the US is just for privately owned firearms.There are more privately owned small arms in American citizens' hands than there are in all of the world's police forces combined. I think the same is true for the world's combined militaries too but I'm not sure about that one. I believe this is also just the number of known guns and that some estimates I've seen though I have no idea where anymore put the total number as high as 500 million. I've seen estimates way higher (as in 1 billion).  The 400M is definitely the number that's backed by some data but I thought it was kinda getting old now.A quick google search is showing FBI background checks for gun sales at 20-25 Million per year.  Now this would include buying used guns from an FFL but not include private party sales of used guns so the amount of new guns sold would be less.  But it's pretty easy to look at 400M and think it seems kinda low. Yeah and it will only get worse as high quality cnc machines and 3D printing become cheaper and more prevalent. You mean better They are already quite good now and cnc mills are already capable of doing everything needed with the proper programming and bits and there are many small enough to everything but barrels for cheap 3D printers of sufficient quality using metal are in the 50-100 thousand dollar range. Insert comment amount rookie numbers and pumping those numbers up We're out-gunned by the rest of the world 613 million to 399 million? Time to do some shopping. Im kind of proud Yemen Punching way above its weight.I would like to point out that most of Americas guns are privately owned That istn the case (outside of maybe Mexico and Yemen) for those other countries. Yemen has guns because it’s in a civil war lol I know Every time someone suggests disarming America show them this. There's almost 100 MILLION more guns than people in the United States. I can just imagine some fed in a nice suit waltzing into a trailer park in Alabama where Cletus and his boys are drinking Coors shooting bottles and talking about the good old days pining for a second civil war and telling them he's here to collect their guns and is willing to use force if they refuse.Surely it would work out just fine. Exactly you're putting the officers at risk too. You can't plan a society around violent/crazy people just not existing Aren't there only like 300 million people in America? You can own more than one gun. Well yeah but... There are more guns than people. That's extraordinary And pro-gunners that don't own any. I don't. I have friends and relatives with more guns than hands that I can mooch off of when the zombie apocalypse comes. Not really. I own >10. Numerically I compensate for probably a dozen anti-gunners. That's the thing. 400 million guns. 300 million Americans and not all Americans own guns so that number is huge. It's not though. If half of Americans own guns then that's two or three guns each on average. Not shocking IMO. I have 7 guns and I only bought my first gun a year ago. These are just rookie numbers.

RoyalManticoranNavy,"You will never see it. They will come up with some other excuse and pivot or make some lame historic link that the Republicans did something X years ago.2 years of publically convicting someone without any real evidence or a trial.  That is what is worrisome.If there had been any proof there would of been a trial Either the media is a free press which proves that the Free Press is far too dangerous to be unregulatedOr it's not actually a free press and therefore it should be regulatedBut from what we've seen: whatever you want to call it. The media that you're looking at is propaganda and cannot be left to be allowed to say whatever it wants. It needs to be regulated to the point where they can receive fines and other punishments when it's found that they are knowingly and purposely lying Wait a conservative asking for regulation of an industry? This is where we’re at? I think the inference from /u/BoringLychee7's second possibility is that the media is already regulated just regulated badly and with sinister intent. I basically agree with that. that's the thing. Conservatives want minimal regulation but they can still support SOME regulation. Just like they want small government but not NO government.it's the corporatists and Libertarians who are opposed to every regulation ever simply because it's called a regulationHonestly a ridiculous ideology to hold. That all regulations ever are bad simply because they're called regulation (if it was called ""law"" they would be less likely to oppose it)then when you think about the people that are actually telling you that all regulations are bad it all makes sense. They are generally people who take lots of money from oil companies and other corporationspeople who support removing all regulations and all government would rather see the world crumble than make any kind of compromisethey can't even truly explain their ideology or how it makes sense. They just know that somebody told them to believe itt Let's not hold our breath.  They've already pivoted to health care and the media have their orders to stop covering this.  It's a soft cover-up and one that merits punishment.(""Punishment"" figuratively.  Like at the polls. Not like that dream I had involving Adam Schiff a riding crop and baby oil.)

The network has zero credibility. As much as I am sickened by the courts ruling that CNN is required to be in the daily press briefings I simply do not understand why the Trump administration can’t assign them to the back of the room against the wall. Why must they be given the opportunity to ask questions? Why can’t Jim Acosta be afforded the same level of access as a reporter from Boise Idaho?

guanaco55,"85% of women who see their baby on ultrasound choose life for their babies.Planned parenthood never shows women the ultrasound screen. (They have to do an ultrasound to determine which abortion procedure to use as it depends on the gestational age/size of the baby) First the subject line is incorrect.  Abortion doesn’t “hurt” a living baby it “kills” them.I saw the movie last night.  It is powerful but I fear it is just preaching to the choir.  I don’t foresee many pro abortion folks taking the time to view it. They are too busy telling us how much they care about women to see anything but their narrative.My story is a good one.  My wife and I had an ultrasound as part of our prenatal screening.  The tech got real  quiet.   The doc came in a few minutes later to tell us our baby likely had thanatophoric dwarfism.  He was doomed to die in utero or soon after birth.We went for a second opinion but we were told the same. We were offered to go to Kansas for a late term abortion. We chose to go forward and let God decide.Weeks later our baby was born. He was failing in utero and was barely responding.   The docs went in with a c section and pulled him out. The moment he came out he was thrashing and crying.  I knew he would be ok.Our son was born at 2 lbs 9 ozs.  He was smaller than many birds. But he hung in there and grew over time.  It was a big deal when he became heavier than our cat.He is 23 now.  He is brilliant and a poet.   He is so thought and the kind of person who anyone would love to have as a friend.  He makes us proud everyday.I can’t imagine if we had listened to the medical professionals and aborted our child rather than giving him his chance at life. Wonderful story!  Thanks for sharing!!!  And thank you God! You didn't see ""a dot. A single cell"" on an ultrasound. That's not how it works. You usually can't see much of anything on an ultrasound until at least 8 weeks and it's definitely not a single cell at that point. Bullshit. Yep. Complete bullshit. You see a bean looking thing very early on but never a “dot single cell” It’s never a single cell well then the lady was bullshitting me but i saw only a small black dot on the screen. Very possible that someone lied to you about the size of the preborn baby. The black dot is the sac. The baby is in one corner of the sac and you'd see it if you zoom in. Think of a tiny chick in an egg. The amniotic sac is like the egg shell (or really that funny membrane that you'd notice if you peeled an uncooked egg *very* carefully or dissolve it in vinegar). Most of the egg is not baby but the baby is in there if you zoom in enough. Yeah OK. Bullshit. I'd say first that you are responsible for being as supportive as you can be for both her and the child you helped create. Don't let her feel for one minute that it's all on her to figure it out.If she's worried about how hard it will be and you don't know how to overcome the difficulties I'd suggest trying to find a pregnancy center in your area and go visit it. There are many charities and aid programs to help young parents prepare for a child.If your girlfriend has already been feed the ""abortion is the only choice"" mantra of the pro-""choice"" movement it's going to be more difficult to convince her of all the options out there. If that's the case I'd suggest doing a lot of research quickly before discussing it with her. Hope you gave the baby up for adoption instead of killing an innocent life that had nothing with how irresponsible you two were. we used a condom it just broke. i get that was probably my fault but still. Y’all were having sex without thought towards what could happen it seems. I’d say that isn’t responsible. Condoms are pretty hard to break bro I'm sure you'll get plenty of responses but I would encourage you to accept responsibility for what happened. Dont try to weasel out of what happened but own it. Maybe you didnt know better then and I don't know what you believe now but there is never an excuse for murder. I'm a Christian so I believe there is hope and forgiveness and redemption but that requires coming to the realization of what you did. Regardless of your religious beliefs dont just toss this aside. We all make mistakes I would implore you to wrestle with this and not brush it off. At 8 weeks it is not a single cell. It's more like 0.5"" but I know what you mean. You can't clearly really see the shape for few more weeks.I seriously don't think other than a handful special ones 18-19 years old should not be raising kids especially with weekend jobs and college.Best advice is probably to give up for adoption. Many people can't have kids but want children.Lot of people in their late 30s aren't even married or are still single. By the time they are read to have kids their chances to get pregnant will be very slim.Honestly I think our society should distribute contraceptives like candies in Halloween openly and without judgement. Society will suffer if people who cannot afford condoms are raising kids. Probably needed a better ultrasound machine. Because of my wife's high risk pregnancies we look at about day 21 (so a week after a missed period or 5 weeks pregnant). We have go to the hospital to the specialist ultrasound machine because the one in the OB office can't see the baby at that stage. But I mean by around that time there is a clear orientation to the body and an unmistakable heartbeat. We were really nervous the last time and the ultrasound tech saw we were nervous. She found the heartbeat but because she's a tech wasn't allowed to give us the 'diagnosis' of a heartbeat. Instead she turned the screen to us and told us ""I can't tell you what you're looking at but I think you know.""We knew... it's pretty obvious on a good machine.To be clear by the time a child has embedded in the uterus (around day 9-12) it's already about multicellular and it more than doubles each day. When we saw our daughter it would have been hundreds of thousands of cells making up her body.To the actual point of the question. Honestly babies are cheap (or at least do not get expensive until many years after birth) and rewarding. Most states will give you a lot of medical aide if you are pregnant and have no or little income (or at least they should). You got the girl pregnant. Step up and do your duty as father. It's not like you were unaware how not to make her pregnant (no sex). it was a dot a single cellAbsolute horseshit. Yeah I'm sure you got an ultrasound 10 minutes after you impregnated your girlfriend /s. Hyperbole is one thing but if we're having a scientific discussion let's not bullshit one another.there was no way for us to support a child with a weekend job and going to college.well then you two don't get to go college or you have to take night courses so you can get an education and pay for childcare. Why do people think goofing off in college is more important than another human being's life?

Foubar,"i saw r/politics take on this yesterday.headline: Rand Paul blocks resolution calling for Mueller report releaseno mention of why just that he ""blocked it""#1 comment: ""What are Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul hiding ?""ironic take since he is explicitly attempting to unhide something extremely important. Also the article makes it clear in the third paragraph what Paul was trying to do but of course nobody on r/politics read the article.Sorting by controversial you find a few souls brave enough to point out the actual truth of the matter. It’s Karma suicide I tell you! don't go in there alone. We need our own Super PAC that can put millions of dollars into trolls to take over that subreddit What I found ironic when lurking through there over the last few days is that same people demanding to read the report - all 300+ pages mind you - and crying about how it hasn't been released yet weren't even capable or willing to read Barr's 4 page summary explaining why.They've been deluding themselves into thinking it's some kind of cover-up because it's ""taking so long"" that Republicans are hiding something and/or that McConnell is complicit because he blocked the votes last week on releasing it.Now they're mad that Democrats may subpoena the report rather than will.They just seem unwilling to understand what is going on regarding the release of the thing- the laws and procedures which need to be followed.When questioned many called out the Starr report and how it took 2 days to be released in its entirety not understanding that the laws surrounding the release of the Mueller report are a direct result of the debacle that followed the Starr report.Buncha morons over there. Sorting by controversial is the only way to get the whole story on Reddit it seem. Ha. The intellectually dishonest and downright dimwits are everywhere. Hilarious. Seems fair. Please god do not fucking do this. Please DO NOT FUCKING DO THIS! If something is found then ok but how far is will we even be able to take it? Maybe the situation is good if convictions of some kind are on the table but that's a long way down the road and very far out of reach at present. If they go after this idea and nothing is found we look like every idiot who screeched about collusion for two years and then democrats get to completely switch from saying not to trust barr or Mueller on the summary or full report and change to haha look at these idiot nazi Republicans. We should be focusing on policy issues where we have an easy time pointing out very radical ideas being put forward by the democratic party instead of going on a goose chase. We gotta stay in our lane. The GOP can push for an investigation into the background of the Russian collusion investigation and carry onward as usual. They don’t need to constantly talk about it and make sensationalized comments while the investigation is ongoing like what the Democratic Party and media did. Investigate the matter and move forward as usual. If something comes out great. If there’s nothing continue moving forward as usual. If they don’t create a big hoopla while the investigation is ongoing it likely wouldn’t hurt them. No no no what you are talking about and what that headline state are two very different matters. I'm more then happy to get the investigation into the Russian investigation started considering we have over 3000 text messages between Peter strzok and his mistress about hating trump and investigating trump preemptively starting on the day he took over the investigation. That's fine. I'm saying that if we start some investigation about obama and something he may have done to influence the 2016 election then we better be beyond damn sure there is some solid Intel to justify the action and be able to accurately link obama to the moving pieces that started the whole investigation. Otherwise we look just as idiotic as the Democrats for leeching off the Russia conspiracy and the narrative goes from being about a failed Democrat conspiracy to Republican retaliation making the broader issue just another case of partisan politics which is not a good look for conservatives. I think we keep the situation grounded by just starting an investigation into the Russia probe and the motivations behind its commencement and if the evidence strings itself back to obama in some way then we go for him. Let's just not put the cart before the horse by saying obama did it prematurely. I understand your reasoning but you get the ""solid intel"" by doing an investigation.I think it is OK to do the investigation just do not make it a continual headline like the MSM did with Russia-Trump collusion. Listen to some Dan Bongino podcasts. I have been listening for over a year and it's like he has a crystal ball. I'm confused what you mean. If you mean that a Special Prosecutor into Democrats or establishment Republicans has the potential to backfire PR-wise then I agree with that but at this stage of the game I think that this is a pretty good statement by Rand Paul and I'm glad that he's continuing to be an ally of the president on this particular issue.",0,False,t3_b6yjdv,14,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b6yjdv/rand_paul_no_mueller_report_release_until_info_on/,181,,Rand Paul: No Mueller Report Release Until Info On Obama's Involvement In 2016 Election Released,181,https://www.redstate.com/brandon_morse/2019/03/28/rand-paul-no-mueller-report-release-info-obamas-involvement-2016-election-released/

zroxx2,Exactly all of that was laid out prior to the release and in the bottom line summary. Shifty and Nardler are a coupla jackasses. And they share the same fervor for fucking things up as the media. The special counsel had two fucking years. Barr has the thing for a day and they started tweaking. Calm down assholes you’ll get the whole report. Still won’t be any Trump Russia collusion. And all involved with this hoax should be held accountable. If anything the thorough investigation and the release of the report provides “validation” to his presidency.  I’m excited to have the report released and getting on with life. Totally. It’s just crazy you have these people clamoring to release it a day after Barr gets its claiming it’s a cover up the media is on board. Yet before it was released by Mueller everyone was on board with the redactions and that it would take a little bit of time. But no one said it wasn’t gonna be released. The media can’t even get the release of this right. They made another conspiracy out of a lawful duty that everyone was aware needed to happen before the public sees it. It’s crazy Right  but every day Barr holds onto it the fervor to GET TRUMP continues to simmer.. if the full report was released the day Barr got it Dems would have jumped all over obstruction.. when this does get released they’ll find something else in there that will force them to subpoena Mueller and Barr which I’m all for.. continue to be consumed with rage have no 2020 agenda and let Trump ride to the most one sided election since George Washington’s unanimous selection.,0,False,t3_b72u4y,5,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b72u4y/breaking_bill_barr_announces_a_release_date_for/,60,,BREAKING: Bill Barr Announces a Release Date for the Full Mueller Report and Rips Media Getting Things Wrong Again,60,https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2019/03/29/breaking-mueller-n2543999

lancerelliott,"Why was special Olympic money coming from the education department This Why is there an education department?Really answer the money was given to the special Olympics to provide physical athletic support for special needs kids in public schools. 10% of thier budget education department is a necessary evil so that all schools are set to the same standard. common core is wrong though it tries to force everyone to learn the same way when in reality kids in one state will learn differently from kids in another state. and again money for special needs kids while in actual school and education fine no problem but to have them compete in an Olympics yeah waste of tax payer money.  If they want to compete fine like Devos said there where literally millions of dollars from private sector to support them. ... education is a state level issue.... A federal education felt is just government for government sake. I agree education is a state level issue however the federal government needs to set the standard for it. Cant have one state deciding that knowing how to add and subtract is a high school level skill when another state says its a grade school one. Sounds like a better reason to get rid of all public schools so that if a school thinks that subtraction is a highschool level (and for a lot of highschoolers it apparently is) subject you send your kids to a different school your missing the point the federal government needs to be involved in order to set the standard. just like they set a standard for measurement and weights they must also set a standard for schools. how the states meet that standard is up to the states. This insures johnny from California knows the same thing Frank from Florida knows and when both of them go work in factory x in Iowa they will both be at the same level of reading and writing this is why the federal government needs to be involved so that the workforce of the USA is somewhat standardized. No I'm not missing the point. I just think it's wrong. People leave public schools with all sorts of different levels of education even from the same school.We don't need government setting standards. We don't need a government to make industry wide standards. Plenty of industries do that already. All you insure is that school now play to government instead of their consumers. No government in schools shit school will sink  effective schools will rise niche schools will snag the weird kids All my liberal friends posting on social media about how the Trump admin is bad for pulling special Olympics funding are going to be very conflicted over this. No they aren't. They will just ignore it. I’ve already seen a few friends of mine frame it as a setup to make trump look like the good guy Just like restoring the great lakes. Which there's a thread in r/environment on it with zero comments and 3 upvotes They're probably going to be happy the extreme backlash caused him to budge. You’re liberal friends are more reasonable than mine. I personally dont think the Feds should be funding this but its small potatoes Yeah this is the kind of stuff that makes the administration look bad. Even if you don't think the federal government should be in this role - and they shouldn't - this gives off the optics that they're taking money away from a universally revered organization just for the sake of saving a few bucks. Defunding Special Olympics is not going to balance the budget. Yeah this is the kind of stuff that makes the administration look bad.Especially when it's being reported in bad faith - that federal funding is a small portion of their income and while it would hurt them they'd still get along just fine.Defunding Special Olympics is not going to balance the budget.By itself? No. But the government funds probably thousands of programs in part or whole.If they identified a large list of small cuts they would add up. Could be in the neighborhood of a couple hundred million to a few billion dollars. That money could be used in a variety of ways - all the way from increased funding for underfunded programs to creating new necessary programs. Welfare is on the scale of a trillion dollars. If we are going to balance the budget it has to be welfare cuts. There is no other way Absolutley welfare and entitlements need to be scaled back but in today's political climate it's a hard sell. One that we may never win.While we fight about what entitlements to cut back we can and should start to cut back in other areas.Areas to start in would be bloat inefficiency misuse of funds (bridges to nowhere high speed rails that don't get built etc) which is estimated to be as high as $1T (cutting even half or a quarter of this would be huge) not increasing military spending every year useless or ineffective programs. Federal assistance or “grants” accounts for 10% of their budget or 15mil and public education and communications accounts for 16% of their expenses or 21mil. I think that’s why feds are funding it because of that public education aspect. Like you said tho 15mil to the government is nothing so it’s not like it’s a huge cut in the federal budget but it does go a long way for those students who rely on the special olympics. That’s why I was against it it’s a relatively small amount the government will save but the impact will be great. Like I said Ideologically we should cut it all but I save my concerns for important topics.I wish we could live in a world where millions to the special Olympics was my actual top government concern. Same :\ I'd rather see the Special Olympics funded than the ACTUAL Olympics. The Special Olympics uses existing facilities instead of forcing cities to spend billions building new facilities which will then be disused afterwards.Why the Olympics continue to happen I don't know.

MaddMarkk,Top Tardsreeeeeeeeeeports:1: I love how salty you get over people calling out alt-right bs. Keep crying chump How dare you make me laugh at this Difference is that her wearing a hijab is a sign of her subservience to the terroristsSombrero wouldn't send the same messagespecifically because she's a woman she's showing that women are not equal to men. She's trying to show them that she's willing to oppose women's rights that's what they ask specifically because she's a woman she's showing that women are not equal to men.Legally they're specifically equal to half a man unless it's a Christian woman then they're legally equal to a quarter of an Islamic man. Is this legit? Look up whose testimonies matter in Islamic courts. It was when I was in Pakistan. A hijab means by definition that men are barely restrained and if women don't cover their hair they are inciting men.I'm not sure why you'd want to get that message across. Strange.Showing solidarity with Muslims is pretty easy: go hang out at the mosque. If i were her instead of doing this stupid stunt I'd open a satellite office across the street from the mosque in question for a few weeks to bring attention to the victims. Get together a few charities to help them repair the mosques spackle some bullet holes clean the carpets etc. Help them find an alternate place to worship. Whatever.

Rightquercusalba,"100%.I'd probably pardon Papadopolous too. Guy did nothing wrong during the campaign so unless there's genuine evidence he lied with intent to deceive versus mis-remembering some dates he's a good candidate too. Good point I agree. How could you ever prove if someone lied with the intent to deceive vs made a mistake? He deserves it he’s a patriot who got sandbagged by corrupt liberals. Agreed. If no one else him. He got fucked over pretty much only for being connected to Trump. Yes - Flynn doesn’t just deserve a pardon he’s owed a pardon. He’s owed MORE than a pardon. Agreed him and his family are owed compensation. Sue the asses of those scumbag Democrats and media hacks (sorry for the redundancy) that helped perpetuate the hoax Russian collusion narrative that started the investigation. Couldn't agree more It'd look bad but ""lying to the fbi"" is a bullshit charge with no underlying crime. The problem is that misremembering an obscure detail is treated as a lie to extract dirt on the real subject of interest in cases like this. He didnt lie. The initial FBI conclusion was that he didnt lie but they decided to bluff him anyway and he fell for it. https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/386323-house-intel-report-comey-mccabe-testified-that-the-two-agents-who This does not say that he didnt lie....The report says McCabe in particular testified that the two agents who interviewed Flynn “didn’t think he was lying.""But guess what - Flynn doesn't know that they came to that conclusion. So instead they thought ""let's tell him we have him making a false statement during that interview and that we'll throw the book at him unless he pleads guilty"". That's what happened. The original agents didn't think he liked that doesn't mean he didn't lieIt means they didnt think he was trying to deceive them. That's the essential part of a lie - it's not a crime to be wrong or honestly mistaken.Flynn himself thought he lied as he pleas guilty to lying to the FBI.I just explained to you why you're wrong. Flynn plead because that was his best option - he would have done so whether or not he was guilty. Had the matter actually been adjudicated in court I dont think he would have been found guilty based on McCabe's own testimony.What would they throw the book at him for?Nothing they had no case. It was a bluff and Flynn fell for it. Guilty pleas are usually deals that give lesser sentences Why would he take any deal unless there was sent kind of legal pressure? Wait for the drama to blow over first.  But I stand with Rand. I'd pardon everybody even manafort. I don't like witch hunts. I wouldn't pardon Manafort. He committed a serious crime and should go to prison. I can see good reasons to pardon Flynn and a few others. I can see your point but if it were me - following the election in 2020 I would pardon Manafort as a finger to people who supported the witch hunt. He didn't do any crime. Good to see that you support the police state fellow conservative. No need to jump on his back.  Even among us conservatives different opinions and schools of though arise. 50/50 chance they are a troll. If not they will surely defend their position and make a good argument for why a man with a long respected military career should be entrapped by the FBI spied on bankrupted have his family threatened and his name dragged through the mud for two years because he had the audacity to support Trump.Oh but wait we were told that Trump colluded with Russia that was a 100% lie and fabrication and Flynn was targetted because he talked to a Russian as the incoming National Security Advisor to the president elect of the U.S. He was ambushed by the FBI and was determined to not have been telling the truth despite the fact FBI investigators didnt believe he was being deceptive.  He had had multiple meeting with foreigners as the incoming NSA. The FBI told him he didn't need a lawyer they left the impression that this was just a routine questioning. It wasnt until Andrew McCabe entered the picture that they used a phone transcript against him to claim he lied.No sorry I'm not going to take it easy on apologists for the police state. Even if it's an honest mistake or misunderstanding ignorance in today's political climate is dangerous. The Russian investigation was political one backed by a hoax dossier. Flynn never ahiukd have been targetted. He never should have been questioned. He doesn't deserve a si ge day in jail and didnt deserve having to sell his house to pay his legal fees. The article says that Flynn also lied to VP pence about meeting with the Russian ambassador which seems sketchy to me since the only other person higher than him is trump but I will reserve judgment until Barr makes the full report public.I also agree with u/tirano3837 just because you have your own point of view of what conservatism is doesn’t mean that anyone who doesn’t agree with you isn’t a conservative. The article says that Flynn also lied to VP pence about meeting with the Russian ambassador which seems sketchy to me since the only other person higher than him is trump but I will reserve judgment until Barr makes the full report public.Flynn told the same stories to both the FBI and Pence the FBI believed that Flynn was not being deceptive. It's possible to not recall a conversation accurately and not be lying. Flynn had that conversation with the Russian ambassador while he was out of the country and on vacation. He had had multiple conversation with numerous ambassadors and diplomats during the transition period as Trump's National Security advisor.You can read the transcript of the conversation which didn't indicate anything was out of the ordinary when Flynn spoke with the ambassador. What he did was 100% legal and part of his job. That's why when the FBI spoke to Flynn his guard wasn't up he didn't request a lawyer he was being friendly and cooperative with the agents.When asked about the conversation he said he didn't have a conversation about sanctions. He could have easily been mistaken and didn't remember fully. His answers didn't match up to a transcript of the phone conversation Flynn was being spied on. That's the  big fucking deal not  that he didn't answer the way the witch hunters wanted.The Russian investigation was a hoax. It was a scam in 2016 and it was a scam when Mueller was investigating it. Flynn was charged by Mueller when Mueller had nothing to do with Flynn being questioned by the FBI. Everyone that wasn't linked to Trump got free passes out of their proven lies. Meanwhile Flynn  despite fully cooperating was made an example of by Mueller. He decided to hang him over a dubious and questionable claim of lies that even the FBI agents didn't believe were lies. That shows that Mueller targeted Flynn for political reasons.  The hell with anyone conservative or otherwise who thinks that Flynn deserved the treatment he received. Those are conservatives that are my adversaries on this issue and I will tear apart their positions every single time.I also agree with u/tirano3837 just because you have your own point of view of what conservatism is doesn’t mean that anyone who doesn’t agree with you isn’t a conservative.This sub is full of concern trolls and fake conservatives. I'm just playing the odds when I say fellow conservstive. Just because you don't agree with me doesn't mean they are conservatives. Like I said if they want to defend their position I'm open for debate but if they want to say ""do the crime do the time"" they are going to be called out. Could you link the transcript? I’d like to read it if you don’t mind. So the Russian ambassador was on vacation or was Flynn on vacation? I assume you’re speaking about the Russian ambassador. I'll try to find the transcript. But to give you an idea of where my argument came from read this article.https://bongino.com/the-framing-of-michael-flynn/https://pjmedia.com/trending/why-michael-flynn-was-set-upHere is a source citing his vacation.https://www.columbiatribune.com/c67a5892-f5ff-11e6-ba5f-10604b9f6eda.htmlAnd I was wrong about public transcripts or at least I can't find them.https://www.columbiatribune.com/c67a5892-f5ff-11e6-ba5f-10604b9f6eda.htmlThis article makes it clear that the FBI found nothing illicit about the conversation. Which begs the question why did they question him about the conversation? Hmmm... maybe because they had a transcript of the convo on December 29th and by January 24th they might be able to trip him up on a question?Here is the timeline.https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/02/14/us/politics/flynn-call-russia-timeline.htmlDecember 29 vacation phone convo. January 14th he tells Pence he didn't discuss sanctions. January 24th FBI questions him without a lawyer.https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mccabe-reveals-the-one-thing-that-stands-out-from-his-fateful-call-with-flynnMcCabe makes it clear that Flynn was being cooperative and was light hearted and thanks them for reminding him about his conversation. McCabe is too dumb to realize that he is bolstering Flynns defence. Why would he lie? I second this. I always thought that something was fishy about the whole Flynn thing but since I don't know where to look for something counter to the narrative I've kept silent.

xFYD_,Shame. Shut up and sing. This doesn’t get said enough. If Headey really believed what she claims she wouldn't have been on a tv show that was shot in five or six countries. She plays Cersei so well because she’s not even acting just being herself. SHAME! I hope her character has a horrendous death in the show. It needs to make Joffrey’s look like a day at the spa. I didn’t watch GOT anyways. More the reason not to I guess With all due respect (and remember I mean with all due respect) that idea ain’t worth a velvet painting of a whale and a dolphin getting it on.GoT is an incredibly entertaining show. Watched 4 seasons of it because I was told it was Jesus Christ in TV form and was bored out of  my damn mind. 50 characters who all get three minutes of screentime every two episodes an unlikeable baby teeth dragon midget who stopped getting naked early on no naked Lena no naked redhead and the Chrome Lesbian from The Last Jedi is all over the place.GOT is the tv version of Fury Road. Everybody loves it but they can't tell you why. “No naked Lena”?Oh my sweet summer child. Fury road is great because it’s literally 2 hours straight of diesel fueled blood soaked action. Beautifully shot with some of the best practical effects in Hollywood. It's a soy-filled lecture about feminism where the main character does nothing of note and it ends with women taking over the last vestige of civilization. But omg a dune buggy flipped in the desert and some S&M weirdo plays the guitar every once in a while! Masterpiece! I heard GoT was good but I had also heard it was practically sex 24/7. That was what dissuaded me. Boobs butts and guts lol (and the occasional floppy wiener).Keep this in mind these things weren’t enough the dissuade the virgin-til-marriage Orthodox Jew Ben Shapiro from being a huge fan of the show lol I think that says a lot about how good it is The sex is pretty well-balanced with the other two focuses: violence and political intrigue. You probably shouldn't take my recommendations though... the sex/violence/intrigue angle is what draws me TO the show not away from it. You heard wrong. I haven’t seen it either and it honestly doesn’t interest me all that much from what I’ve heard. Not a big show watcher. Damn.

xFYD_,That is messed up.This court got their ruling dead wrong given the existence of a mutually binding legal document in place (which the court ignored).This man doesn’t want to be a father and in fact didn’t “do the deed” so while the child would absolutely be biologically his forcing him to pay child support would be criminal.This is about as close to raping a man and his rights as you get without physical force or drugs. Riddle me this; if he can be forced into parenthood then is there is any reason to allow convince abortion? is there is any reason to allow convince abortion?I’m not sure what you’re asking here.I’m fully against abortion in any case that doesn’t involve a high risk of mortality of the mother child or both and even then terminating a pregnancy in self defense (so to speak) is still a horrific act. One of the big reasons in allowing abortion is the mother to choose when to become a parent (hence the names “pro choice” and “planned parenthood”) .I am saying if this man is not allowed to object to the implantation of this embryo and is forced into parenthood against his will then it stands to resin anyone can be forced into parenthood. Essentially a nullification of the parenthood choice argument .edit mobile typo I agree with your logic but the premise of a woman’s right to choose extending past the decision to have sex thus overriding the babies right to live is already a grotesque farce. What the hell? From the description it seems like they're already fertilized just frozen? If they are then OP's title is a little misleading. Absolutely agree morally.However under the law the legal system does not believe they are separate life forms. These people are -- under law -- wholly subject to their parents will.

iamtherealbeethoven,"What's with politicians getting dumber in the past 20 years? Are politicians getting dumber or are the people voting getting dumber and choosing worse candidates? I think there is a loop to be honest. Politician seeing that all people want to hear is that their position in life isn’t because of themselves but because of injustice or/and racism.This leads to people believing in it and listening to politician who says so. Afterwards moderate politician aren’t getting a say because no one is interested hearing how they aren’t oppressed.The media get most attention and money by showing the worst in society and having a left bias.Left bias news outlet lead to massive brainwashing leading to people voting for more and more extreme politicians. Extreme candidate will again continue the loop.That’s at least my idea. Or what do you think? The school systems and college systems. There is a reason we've gone from teaching latin and greek to remedial English and it isn't the flood of foreign nationals it is the leftist capture of school systems. they got the Universities locked down completely by the conclusion of the Vietnam war because not only were they targeting academia the use of universities as draft deferments meant that a lot of subhumans were going to school for the sake of going to school and had no plan other than deferment so they stayed in what they knew which was the university system. The good men went to war and the bad ones entrenched themselves hiding in plain sight like the university system. They captured the primary school systems through unionization. They essentially control K-post graduate education in this country and they chose to abandon educating to embrace indoctrinating. Now we have generations of improperly educated people who literally don't know the evils of socialism or incredibly racist social justice. 100% right. And taking back our education system is second only to taking over the media in terms of long term importance.People have no sense of history. Hitler and Stalin talked about social justice all the time. ""Social justice"" is just rhetoric. It's synonymous with ""collective revenge"" but that doesn't sound as good.Take anything written by a SJW and switch our white and men with Jews. You literally can't tell the difference between it and Nazism. There's a subreddit for that although I forget the name. /r/menkampf There are two - one that deliberately switches them out and one that blanks out words and asks if it was said by the ctrl-left or the alt-right. I agree that this is what’s happening. Because of social media echochambers and the polarization of traditional media people have lost all sense of skepticism of these types of claims because they are “validated” by “independent” parties and because they are exposed to thousands of others believing exactly as they do (and repeatedly reinforcing those beliefs through comments online).It’s very similar to how a cult works. It’s the dumb men strategy. The Republicans actually were the first to utilize it in the 90’s. They got respectable intelligent men to play dumb. To be the guy you could get a beer with. One of us. It worked so well that people started electing actual dumb men. (cough Bush cough) Not that I dislike Bush jr but I mean. Mostly senators and representatives but Bush and Trump embody this. That whenever you love em or hate em is the new Republican Party and it seems the Democrats are following in our footsteps Don't give me that crap about Bush Jr being dumb. As  for implying that Republicans like Reagan played dumb is equally odd. Trump isn't dumb either. Looks like the media jammed that spoon in your mouth and you ate every last crumb. I mean seriously... name the last Republican that played dumb. Bush sr Reagan Ford Nixon Eisenhower. Some politicians just speak plainly and don't care to blow smoke up peoples asses when they don't need to. True Both.  It's both.Most people don't understand how our government is supposed to operate.  They are completely unfamiliar with Western principles and classics in literature.  Whole generations now have been completely inoculated from the Western Ethos and have no conceptions as to what a civil society is or should be.If we're seeing a rash of weak politicians its indicative of a weak electorate. AOC got propelled to power by running in a straight blue ticket district and winning only 15000 votes against a weak Republican. My guess is she's getting outed in the next primaries by another Democrat along with the other Hamas hummingbirds.Either she goes back to shaking drinks or she runs for president in a decade or so let's hope it's the former. Either way Zoomers look to be quite conservative/anti-SJW edge lords the future of Conservatism isn't as grim as people make it out to be in my opinion. Yes. I think politicians are getting dumber and crazier. On both sides. I think it’s a little bit of both It is most definitely the people that are getting dumber. Illegal aliens voting and rampant socialism being indoctrinated into people They’re not dumb.  You don’t get to be one of the most powerful people on the planet (especially in a democratic republic) by being a moron.They understand the rules of the game.  There’s a video on YouTube by CGP Grey called Rules for Rulers that explains it very well and the book from which said video draws inspiration The Dictator’s Handbook is also fantastic.  It explains why politicians act in such destructive hypocritical and seemingly-stupid manners when they’re actually doing exactly what they need to do in order to obtain and retain power. So AOC's persona is an act? They are starting to more accurately reflect the population.

chabanais,Outstanding! From page 26 of 86 of the opinion:3. Lethality is Not the TestSome say that the use of “large capacity magazines” increases the lethality of gun violence. They point out that when large capacity magazines are used in mass shootings more shots are fired more people are wounded and more wounds are fatal than in other mass shootings. That may or may not be true. Certainly a gun when abused is lethal. A gun holding more than 10 rounds is lethal to more people than a gun holding less than 10 rounds but it is not constitutionally decisive. Nothing in the Second Amendment makes lethality a factor to consider because a gun’s lethality or dangerousness is assumed. The Second Amendment does not exist to protect the right to bear down pillows and foam baseball bats. It protects guns and every gun is dangerous. “If Heller tells us anything it is that firearms cannot be categorically prohibited just because they are dangerous.” Caetano v. Massachusetts 136 S. Ct. 1027 1031 (2016) (Alito J. and Thomas J. concurring); Maloney v. Singas 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211546 *19 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 14 2018) (striking down 1974 ban on possession of dangerous nunchaku in violation of the Second Amendment and quoting Caetano). “[T]he relative dangerousness of a weapon is irrelevant when the weapon belongs to a class of arms commonly used for lawful purposes.” Id.California law presently permits the lethality of a gun with a 10-round magazine. In other words a gun with an 11-round magazine or a 15-round magazine is apparently too lethal to be possessed by a law-abiding citizen. A gun with a 10-round magazine is not. Missing is a constitutionally-permissible standard for testing acceptable lethality. The Attorney General offers no objective standard. Heller sets out a commonality standard that can be applied to magazine hardware: is the size of the magazine “common”? If so the size is constitutionally-protected.If the “too lethal” standard is followed to its logical conclusion the government may dictate in the future that a magazine of eight rounds is too lethal. And after that it may dictate that a gun with a magazine holding three rounds is too lethal since a person usually fires only 2.2 rounds in self-defense. This stepped-down approach may continue32 until the time comes when government declares that only guns holding a single round are sufficiently lacking in lethality that they are both “safe” to possess and powerful enough to provide a means of self-defense.,0,False,t3_b75f2b,2,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b75f2b/district_court_permanently_enjoins_california/,13,,District Court permanently enjoins California magazine confiscation law,13,https://reason.com/volokh/2019/03/29/district-court-permanently-enjoins-calif

IrishHonkey,"The simple answer is “no one actually knows for certain” That's true. It would be technically impossible to know for certain. You can't run thousands of experiments and manipulate all the variables. We only have one earth and we don't even understand it fully. But the people whose job it is the understand it have come to a general consensus that rapid increases in greenhouse gases over the past century have begun to change our climate. It's our best guess.Where the break happens is when the people whose expertise is in climate studies begin to make political and economic statements under the guise of science. It's great for a scientist to say ""My data suggests global temperatures will rise 5 degrees over the next century."" That's good evidence driven science. It's wrong of a scientist to say ""We must put a tax on carbon emissions."" That's activism. When the biggest pushers of global warming strain for explanations with cow farts and ripping out every single building in America but ignore things like the urban heat effect Asian pollution being far more than anything the US could put out in a decade (because it would be racist to say India and China countries with over a billion people each who shit in their rivers and toss their plastic wrappers into said rivers bear responsibility for cleaning up their environments because it’s the US’ fault they don’t have clean water) ignore that the Earth is coming out of a mini ice age from the 1500’s on it’s hard to see their claims as anything other than disingenuous America-bashing. Look at any graph they post that “proves” Global warming it’s usually always skewed to hell and the y-axis is amplified so that your looking at hundredths of a percent change and the category is some super specific sub field. Case in point i had a local weatherface post some graphic on his Facebook about the date of first frost getting later and later from the 1890’s on. Of course he never actually “said” he was blaming climate change. So looking at the data generally everything fell between the last week of October and second week of November (because winter starts in the third week of December...). At first glance it looks so alarming “OMG THE GRAPHS SHOOTS UP AT THE END!” Except there were 3 cycles displayed in that 120 years the last being a downsloping one that ended around 1980 then the dates began to rise after that. I pointed out the fear mongering he was using and he responded “if you don’t see that the dates are CLEARLY getting later I don’t know what to tell you”. You could run a laser level through that graphic and it would show and equilibrium with there having been 2 outliers on either side. By the way after that i notated that our first frost was November 7 right in the middle of the trend.I’m not smart enough to know if the world is heating or cooling but I’m not arrogant enough to say that humanity has more of an impact than millennia of climate cycling sun cycling volcanic activity especially without factoring in big pieces like global shipping indoor climate controls (if we artificially heat our homes for the last 100 years that energy eventually goes somewhere) or even that the data is skewed because most of it comes from cities which suffer from the urban heat effect (a completely separate phenomenon. Telling me that I’m responsible and should stop eating beef and drive a windmill powered car (“the Dutch do it!”) just reeks of agenda pushing and makes me not take your claim seriously. Well said. Even if we do have an impact we can't trust the government to do anything about it. Look at the lunatics that spearhead the ""green movement."" So text for the link didn't show but even sites like Gizmodo are talking about climate change. But this one is talking about climate change during the Neanderthals and how they'd supposedly turn to cannibalism at a time of rough climate.But they didn't have cars or the aerospace industry or large manufacturing plants etc. We read about periods of heating and cooling centuries ago and centuries apart theorized by the sun's own activity. And if the Neanderthals experienced one of these shifts it's entirely possible the earth's climate really is cyclic.Those darn Neanderthals should have implemented socialism! /s Sorry to change the topic but anyway...For several years there has been a movement in anthropology to blame humans for everything from natural disasters to extinctions. Humans are supposed to be responsible for wiping out the mega-fauna of North America. But apparently that same principle does hold for those physically mentally and morally superior neanderthals. Instead the authors of the study in the article blame the European extinction on improved climate conditions with longer growing seasons. Yeah that makes a lot of sense. We've got so little data to go on that any serious answer has to be ""We aren't sure but:""and the but: includes human activity volcano activity solar activity our position in the interstellar medium and radiation solar and extrasolar changes in relation to that.There's a long list. Deforestation ice loss reflectivity loss on the ice we have factors go on and on and on.Human activity is definitely a part of it. What percentage is up for discussion. considering a single volcanic eruption even a minor one can emit more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than all humans and human-related industry in the entire world in a span of 250 years...I'm pretty much of the mind that humans are not and generally can't have any meaningful effect negative or positive on the climate.A little over a century ago there were 75 million or more American bison roaming the US before they were nearly hunted to extinction now there are roughly 500000 left. Bison are larger and far more active than cattle meaning they would need to eat as much or more than our current dairy and beef cattle. There are around 100 million cattle in the US right now therefore methane emission from livestock have remained essentially the same over the last century the source has shifted a bit. India holds 250 million cattle...over 25% of the world's population.While climate change isn't something that can be denied it is also something that we can't do anything about be it making things worse or better. Average global surface temperature since 1880 has risen at a linear rate a grand total of 0.8 degrees with no acceleration with the dawn of industry. Average ocean temperature has risen 0.7 degrees in the same span. When Antarctica's average temperature is in the range of -10 (warmest part) to -75 (coldest part) (-25 to -50 most common range) less than 1 degree is not going to amount to much. Almost all life in any form has a tolerance of at least a few degrees in either direction.I'm not going to waste any worry on climate change. Well the SUN is brighter by .1% since 1880.  A brighter sun may have an impact - (sarcasm).  https://www.space.com/2942-sun-activity-increased-century-study-confirms.html https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2003/0313irradiance.html",0,False,t3_b77vyx,10,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b77vyx/wait_hold_on_so_is_climate_change_our_byproduct/,6,,Wait hold on.

GuitarWizard90,I listened to him speak about this incident and what he’s trying to do to make parents aware of the Not My Kid syndrome regarding opioids. His son took what he thought was a Xanax he got from a classmate in an attempt to help reduce college stress. Turned out to not be a Xanax but something else that had him ODing and dying. Total accidental and a complete tragedy.One would have to be a total sewage seeping creep to make a comment in passing like that about a late child. I miss seeing Eric Bolling on the Five. He's an outstanding person and father. He showed considerable restraint if all he did was use words.We need to see the faces of these slugs. They need to be named shamed and revealed. They are sub-human degenerate SCUM and they need to feel tremendous amounts of pain for what they're willing to do. Exactly. If they’re going to Doxx everyone they disagree with (including Senators like Lindsey Graham and media people like Tucker Carlson) then we need to sling back. I’m sick and tired of Conservatives walking on eggshells while the Left gets away with shit like this nearly every day. Fuck leftism. I think what helps separate us from them is the fact that we don’t sling back. Seriously. If my kid had died and someone said something like that to me I'd probably lose it. I disagree. No more shaming or doxxing from anyone. That includes your side. Let's be better together. Seriously. I think we can do it. You can start by reconsidering the answer to this comment. Just think what we could do together. So many sick dangerous psychos on the left. I think the person who made the comment to Eric is the scum of the Earth. I also think there is the possibility the person was right. Eric's son died the very day the story broke about Eric's sexual harassment of co-workers and his departure from Fox. His son obviously loved Eric and held him in the highest esteem. It must have been absolutely devastating for the son to witness his beloved father's fall from grace.Perhaps Eric's son was a novice at drug abuse or conversely had been using drugs for some time....and - either way - his death that day was as Eric insists - entirely coincidental.....a tragic accident. Perhaps he used that day (or possibly even upped the dose) to deal with the pain/shame of his father's fall and then subsequently died still an accident but one facilitated by his father's scandal. Perhaps his death was a bonafide suicide. We'll probably never know.I have the greatest empathy for Eric Bolling. I've thought about him a lot since his son's death. In fact it is the very possibility that Eric was indirectly responsible for his son's death that evokes such empathy. I put myself in his shoes and I can literally comprehend on a visceral level the word 'agony'. I think he loved his son so dearly that the thought of his scandal being a possible catalyst for his son's death is simply too unbearable for him to face.Eric certainly has every right to construct his own narrative surrounding his son's passing. As free human beings we have every right  to discuss the story among ourselves and offer our own speculations.

For the latter there are to be reports from the Attorney General to the chairs and ranking minority members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees (section 600.9) on appointment of special counsel on the removal of special counsel and on the conclusion of a special counsel’s investigation.At the end of a special counsel’s investigation section 600.8(c) of the regulation provides that a special counsel “shall provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.” The special counsel’s obligation to file “a summary final report” is “limited.” The counsel’s report is to be “handled as a confidential document as are internal documents relating to any federal criminal investigation.” 64 Fed. Reg. 37041. The problem is that most people don't understand the difference between Special Counsel and ""Independent Counsel"" (that was used for the Bill Clinton investigation).  Independent Counsel statutes were not renewed in 1999 and new rules were enacted by the DoJ that created the Special Counsel.  It operates under different statutes/rules than Ken Starr did.Fun aside: Because of how the Special Counsel was funded there's an interesting legal theory that the funding behind the Mueller probe was illegal and anyone prosecuted under it could argue as such. most people don't understand the differenceNo most people are reading talking points and following orders.

Now they're complaining about what they themselves advocated for. Typical democrats. The left: “Nope uh uh. Collusion happened so the report must be immediately made in public.”Sane person: “Read the law retard.” If Barr was covering up the findings  Muellers team would have leaked some info by now.  Dems are doubling down on their stupidity. The damn report is 100% likely to be leaked. Every news agency in the world is going to pay top dollar to get a copy of it first. I imagine there's hundreds of people calling news agencies claiming they have a copy of it right this minute in order to try and extort some cash.Why in the world would Barr lie in a summary report of something that's 100% certain to be out there eventually?

SlimTidy,"Wait. Unprotected sex with strangers isn't a good idea? I think sex with strangers is almost a bigger problem. On a much deeper level I would agree. You just need to be more POZitive Positivity is the problem - positive with syphilis and Gonorrhea. Your not wrong. The whole article is poison and doesn’t call for these “communities” to take a bit of responsibility for their actions.It’s always that the government needs to do more. I find myself saying the same thing with abortion.Not only is abstinence not considered as an option it’s ridiculed by the left.Any time I bring up the idea that a society that encourages frivolous sex (with strangers) instead of one that encourages sexual responsibility will lead to more unwanted pregnancies I’m met with ridicule and labeled a “primitive prude”.God forbid we teach people to have responsibility over their sexuality.I understand abstinence is “not perfect” because people aren’t perfect. But let me ask you something.What will more likely lead to an unwanted pregnancy?Telling a teenager to have promiscuous sex with whomever they want whenever they want (and promise abortion) [and they have sex 4 days a week] or teaching a kid to practice abstinence (they’re not perfect but they decrease the amount to twice a month)?It’s a simple numbers game not even a religious argument. Yet the left doesn’t want to hear it. They don’t like the way it makes them feel.The truth doesn’t care about your feelingsThey also ridicule the idea that it’s wise to wait to have sex atleast until it’s with someone with whom you’re willing to raise a child.They just want to get their nut and have the “right” to kill another human being if it gets in their way. I’ve tried to make that argument several times — if you can’t afford being pregnant or don’t want to be pregnant don’t have sex. The left treats this as a form of suppression and labels you ignorant for even suggesting such a thing. They hate the idea of personal responsibility so much and believe the government should be their lifeline when times get hard. It’s ridiculous. A little shame can go a long way.  I’m not talking about going back to the dark ages like the religion of peace promotes but a little shame in getting pregnant accidentally or sleeping around. I agree!But unfortunately we live in a society where promiscuity is seen as “empowering” for women (and men) and they’re told to “shout their abortion”.Pop culture is cancer on a healthy society. It costs me money to help this ho Sam. My careful and responsible approach keeps me at low risk from STIs and drug problems but it still costs me more so “recently uninsured Sam” can be a tramp. If you think that sucking on some random dudes butthole makes you a tramp then who isn’t guilty am I right?  Right?  Hello.  Anyone?? The key word is random. Hookup culture is expensive to medicate. The real spread of STDs has always been the biggest problem amongst gay men.  The problem now is that these “gay” men are also sleeping with women and it would almost be a stigma for a young girl now to say that she didn’t want to sleep with a guy just because he had slept with other dudes.As a matter of fact I’ve heard them say that on one of the trash tv shows we watch.  Some gay (sorry Bi) dude was mad that sometimes girls didn’t want to sleep with him just because he also likes to sleep with other dudes.Man some girls can be such prudes! Sure more sex can lead to higher rates of infections but that’s not really the point here.Not a joke that is actually written by a Doctor who is ""concerned"" about reducing the amount of STI's..... I think you mean “doctor” hahah There is no excuse for getting an STI. Wrap your willy or don't have sex. If you get AIDS or syphilis because you couldn't keep your shit safe then that is on you not me. I will go out on a skinny ledge here and would say that if you are sleeping with someone who you need to use a condom with to prevent an STD that in itself is a problem.....  use them to prevent pregnancy sure.I’d argue that a better way to prevent STDs is to make sure you really know the person you are sleeping with for more than a few days et cet. My willingness to ""live and let live"" is inversely proportional to the degree that I'll be responsible for paying for someone else's mistakes. I totally agree.  Whether that “paying” is monetarily or personal safety et cet. While we may be detecting more cases through screening there are still many groups who are not being screened at all or not nearly as much as they should. People of color LGBTQIA and young people can be marginalized from accessing health services due to poverty stigma lack of sex education discrimination and harmful government policies. The same factors that limit their access to healthcare also put them at risk for STIs. Ensuring low cost or free STI screenings through the Title X program has made it so that these marginalized groups can get the care they need.This is code for blaming conservatives for the disgusting deviant nature of a large portion of the “alphabet acronym” population. It’s funny because this article does a great job of listing all of the actual causes of the rise in STDs but somehow misses it completely and instead blames the usual too conservative government that won’t give them more money.Actual problems.-sucking on random dudes buttholes -promiscuity -unprotected sex -“dating” apps -nearly the whole alphabet-acronym “community” -sex with “several” people in the past few monthsNot the problemConservative AmericansGod please take me back to a time when sex was a taboo subject. I agree. Point the finger somewhere else and complain about not enough money.I think society is constantly shown risqué pictures for advertising  sex in just about every tv show dating apps massive porn industry. People feel like they have to go out and bang every person that walks into their life.Instead of people taking responsibility for themselves and saying. “You know I’m not insured right now I should be a pretty careful about what I do.”  No they continue to do what they want and cry to have everyone else pay for their mistakes.",0,False,t3_b6yc3f,31,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b6yc3f/i_am_tired_of_hearing_that_i_need_to_pay_for_the/,48,,I am *TIRED* of hearing that I need to pay for the deviant promiscuous nature of these individuals!!!

the_perfect_drug_,"This is not satire... I know it really feels like some cruel joke where writers for The Onion have taken over reality but this is super serious guys and gals.Apparently this is an acting award... But it's for Empire. They should give him the award for his performance in the ABC interview with Robin Roberts. It’s all part of a narrative this is what they do. Doesn’t matter how rediculous and gross what he definitely did is if you clog up the media with your narrative and it overpowers the others they win. This is what they do and will continue to do. He’s maintaining complete innocence for the narrative. He doesn’t care about being truthful facing consequences he knows all he has to do is hold his ground and people will forget or simply buy into the narrative and he’ll be at all the galas in no time and a champion of civil rights or some horse shit. A fraud nominated for a fake award nothing to see here. I hope he wins it too just so it can highlight how much bs the NAACP actually pushes. My thoughts exactly. This would be just as pointless as Obama winning the Noble Peace Prize. Wtf. So bazaar. “Good for him” “the system worked in his favor”. Wow. So all those black police officers who were just doing their job bad for them cause their part of that system. I’m gonna say this is more about that privilege than color. Two tiered justice the connected vs the normies. Exactly correct. There's the ruling elite and there's everyone else. Just disgusting; if liberals had any principles they would be disgusted too. r/nottheonion So Anthony Anderson is literally retarded huh Yeah apparently 🤷🏻‍♂️ yeah no kidding. He went from not on my radar to one of the absolute Most Stupid People Anywhere Not Just in Hollywood. Wait; this is real? Not satire?What a time to be alive. My reaction exactly 😂 NAACP race-baiting?  Nah that cant be... LOLZ While your statement is probably true that this is an acting award I vaguely remember that part of the scam was because he was about to be released from the show. So while the official statement if acting the real answer is something else entirely. We live in a remarkable time where reality is merely a feeling. Reporters who write a fictional account of Russian collusion involving a duly elected President win a Pulitzer Prize. An actor creates a fictional account of a ""hate crime"" has a corrupt Chicago politician (is that redundant?) drop the felony charges and now he is worthy of an award. Remarkable. This is perfect.  I hope he wins.A prominent black person can go out and perpetuate a blatant and poorly conducted hate crime.  Then he gets off scott free and the NCAACP gives him a fucking award.  This would let every Caucasian in the country know the hatred that blacks and leftists have for them.Remember. These folks hate you.  Act accordingly. That's a very thickheaded borderline racist thing to say and makes me think you've never interacted with many black people in your life. Don't lump them in with leftists. The NAACP doesn't speak for all black people. Neither does Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson or anyone else. This is the thing leftists do now pitting races against each other. Any conservative should be openly embracing any other conservative minded folk. What color you are doesn't tell me who you are. And we damn well don't all need to be the same kind of conservative. There is diversity of thought in conservatism and we should embrace it from wherever it comes from. Don't sink to their level. Its true that I spoke in some generalities that certainly doesn't apply in all cases.  For that let me apologize.It is somewhat infuriating to listen to a media system that does nothing but talk about white privilege and watch as things like this happen.  I would also point out that blacks as a population vote about 90% democrat which is the party of the NAACP identity politics and pitting races against each other.  You would agree that blacks in general support and vote overwhelming for leftists causes?   I hope that is changing but I believe that is the reality we still live in.I wholeheartedly support the concept that what color one is does tell me their character and that conservatives should embrace other conservatively minded folks. No need to apologize I think we all fall into that way of thinking occasionally. It's too easy to nowadays and we just need a friendly reminder of what we're really doing when we think like that which is why I didn't explicitly say you're racist or anything. I don't know you personally and it wouldn't be fair or honest to make that judgment based on just that particular comment. You're right in noting that blacks as a whole vote overwhelmingly democrat but a leftist could say the same about whites making up like 77% of republicans therefore racism. Which they sadly probably say. But it's a faulty way of thinking and the left is superb with using certain words and phrases and framing statistics any which way to push forth their narrative.I'm not entirely sure if I feel that blacks overwhelmingly vote for leftist causes but certainly they vote democrat overwhelmingly. I do know that leftism comes and goes in waves. The last big one was the late 60's and 70's which weren't very good times. And the latest one is going on right now. I think that with a larger black middle and upper class they'll tend to vote more conservatively as every other group does with exceptions of course. Once you feel the sting and see the lack of results you start to see democrats policies for what they are. The left and the media is working very hard with their narratives to prevent that. And sometimes I think they're winning. But people are changing their minds. It only takes exposing a few of the left's lies to make someone want to question more or all of it. Overall I'm hopeful though. I really do think that would be the nail in the coffin for the left in this latest wave of leftism if enough people who are minorities get fed up with the lefts lunacy but it's an uphill battle right now. It's tough to convince people to change their mind if they think one party is actively trying to help them and another is actively against them. I think its past borderline racist To be clear this is how Al Sharpton became a civil rights icon. He perpetuated a fake hate crime in New York in the 80s that was deemed absolutely fake by all investigations. It tore the city a part ruining the reputations of multiple people.After which he was a media icon beloved by the left.",0,False,t3_b6vi6p,22,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b6vi6p/jusse_smollett_nominated_for_naacp_image_award/,117,,Jusse Smollett nominated for NAACP Image Award... 🤦🏻‍♂️,117,https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/03/28/jussie-smollett-up-naacp-award-host-anthony-anderson-hopes-he-wins/3298234002/

Spcone23,"Top Minds are obsessed with this post.  They keep catcalling r/conservative is obsessed with her every move though Keep your friends close and your enemas closer Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake...and highlight all those mistakes to show people how truly crazy your enemy is. She's practically guaranteed reelection for as long as she wants and is positioned for a leading role in the party's powerful liberal wing going forward in no small part due to conservative media slathering her with free headlines and attention. Doesn't really sound like a mistake to me Pissing away 25000 jobs and framing it as if NY was going losing money is going to make a tough fight when her next primary comes around.  Someone half decent that can use her same platform while explaining in plain language why people are still unemployed in her district will primary her with ease. Unfortunately you may be right. Any publicity is good publicity it seems. Instead of dragging her out into the light what would be your strategy? Should we just ignore her and hope she goes away?Personally I think the amount of jokes and highlighting the ridiculousness of the GND helped with the vote on it.  Do you think the Dem congressmen would have still just voted ""present"" if we hadn't made fun of it as much? I mean I personally wouldn’t call it obsessed. I think she’s proposing unconstitutional legislation because she does not understand congress’ role and limitations.She and other socialists voted in to the legislature are making these assumptions that are radical to our constitution. I personally know my state has a green bill proposed by the state legislature and waiting state senate approval. Which should pass.She’s the main reason that our founding fathers pointed out that understanding our constitution in its entirety should be truly known for the individuals you vote for.Either most voters now a days do not know the constitution or just say it’s a bad piece of paper. Which the latter is what AOC is stating by calling the country garbage and trying to go outside of its strict regulations to propose nonsense.She’s the front line anti-USA and needs to be called out for it drug through the mud and “burned at the stake” so to say. And to reiterate “burned at the stake” I mean she needs to be stripped of the powers she is flexing and made a model of what not to do in our country. What does TMOR mean TopTardsOfReddit 44% of democrats haven't heard enough about her to form an opinion compared to 23% republicans.Simply put she doesn't have ""brand recognition"" among people who are more likely to boost her ratings whereas she is well-known among those who are more likely to dislike her mostly due to the lunatics in Fox News and Breitbart obsessively covering her these past months. It’s all media coverage. Other democratic legislative even said they did not know why all media outlets are fixated on AOC Ilhan Ohmar and Kamala Harris when they’ve got another 62 freshmen representatives. Don’t try to just push this on Fox.She’s crazy that’s all there is to it. My argument wasn't ""Left-leaning media doesn't cover her"" but rather ""Right-wing media covers her more"".... Which is easily seen by the fact that republicans mostly know who she is whereas almost half of democrats don't know/aren't sure. Same applies to independents who largely don't know her.Meanwhile high-profile conservatives have been foaming from their mouths in anger about her as if she were the devil herself.Crazy or not its pretty clear that she's hitting the right-wingers in their trigger-points and as long as she does that the media will be discussing her core issues i.e. working-class policies economic inequality and climate change rather than letting outrage news like Fox News or Breitbart control the conversation. And the reason why so many republicans are upset about this is because the federal government does not have the power to dictate any of those things. If she wanted change like that should of ran for state legislature not state representative. I don’t understand why it’s a “bad and cheating like scandal” when republicans are up in arms about an idiot democrat but when the democrats are doing the same shit about trump or anyone else it’s hail to the country to gather and support. That’s ignorant To know know know her...Is to loathe loathe loathe her..And I doAnd I doAnd I do Her looks get clicks.  That's it.   Nothing more.

CherryCokeNixon,"Ann Coulter warmed us this would happen She was right But all the Trump cultists are busy attacking her on Twitter for trying to push Trump to close the border and not simply getting down and sucking him off no matter what he does I'm one of the few MAGA pedes that supports coulter. She was right. She is right. Border should have been #1. He didnt have to wait or talk about it. He could have done it day one exactly the way he is doing it now. Seconded. Why tf didn’t he do it when republicans owned the senate and congress? Paul Ryan actively screwed him. That and regardless he would need 60 Senators on his side and there were people like Flake and McCain who were wholly unreliable As long as he gets it done I’m happy. But the delay probably cost us another half a million aliens Because there was not 60 to pass it escpially with the likes of McCain. Because the majority of ""conservative"" Republicans in Congress are neo con Trotskyists who are worried about reelection.Can't actually put your neck out there and have principles in writing on legislation. Just idiotic politicial theater in worthless hearings. I loved when Martin Skreli (pharma bro) just laughed at them when he testified to Congress. fuck Coulter.  She’s worst than a Monday morning quarterback.  What has she accomplished other than talking? Trump is constrained by checks and balances which is a good thing.  He needs other people to get on board.  Putting the blame squarely on him shows that people don’t know shit about how US budget and legislative action works. It also doesnt help that when he actually TRIES to do something you have a not insignificant amount of Republicans in the Congress who start autistically screeching about ""principals"" (apparently not realizing that good politics is equal parts principals AND PRAGMATISM) and joining the Dems to start stabbing him. And even then he IS actually getting shit done its just usually under the radar because it would not serve the interest of the media to report it. Agreed. Our conservative politicians are weak af. He could try and hire people who are on board his own agenda. His administration is full of people opposed to his own immigration policies. Why the hell is someone like Kris Kobach not in the admin while Nielson and people who want more illegal immigration remain? Or maybe people just get tired when you’re constantly ranting for the sole purpose of making headlines. She’s called for Trump to be impeached already. She says concern-troll things on a regular basis like recently where she said Trump tweeting means he’s ignoring the border crisis. Why should anyone put up with her? Does she have valuable information on the border? Or is she just an ordinary commentator who used to be a great voice on immigration issues? I'm willing to vote for an open borders Democrat at this point. Just to speed up the collapse and to get the rest of the country to wake up and take this seriously.If nothing is done it's going to get ugly with militias on the border. Did the swamp eat Trump? I hope Dtone gets a pardon Didn't she call out Trump after he had praised Coulter in an official speech? She's like the embodiment of a crazy catlady. It has been happening. A lot for many decades. Right this conversation is 50 years too late. This is the aftermath not the beginning. I refuse to believe this flood is arriving organically but our media (yet again) fails us in reporting what is going on No matter if intentional or not illegal immigration must be stopped at all times.But it is worrying there’s a possibility this could be orchestrated. There are groups in the USA who facilitate these migrations coaching the participants on how to surrender to Border Patrol and the key words to use to request asylum. They hand out pamphlets with instructions etc. and once the illegal immigrants are across the border they help them get into the interior. It's blatantly illegal to aid and abet in this way (you're not even supposed to transport illegal immigrants but I doubt the US government is going to prosecute Greyhound) but this is what you get when you fail to enforce the law.",0,False,t3_b6n2of,264,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b6n2of/former_cia_analyst_buck_sexton_is_about_to_be/,1702,,Former CIA analyst Buck Sexton is about to be called a racist.,1702,https://i.redd.it/umc5pzeiuwo21.jpg

Horace_Mump,">Non-Muslim girls and women in Pakistan are very vulnerable to kidnap forced conversion and marriage to Muslims and authorities rarely intervene. A report compiled by a Pakistani NGO in 2014 estimated that every year at least 700 Christian and 300 Hindu girls and young women in Pakistan suffer this kind of abuse.While the Western world obsesses over even the slightest hint of ""Islamophobia"" the rights of non-Muslims in the Islamic realm are trampled upon every day. As more and more Muslims enter the West we are going to see more and more examples of the same kind of abuse and supremacism Muslims lord over non-Muslims....and the Western left will be ably assisting in any way possible. People are changing their tune slowly.Completely anecdotal but my old man is a relatively liberal Christian. He was already pretty protective over the islamaphobia issue. Recently he’s been exposed to more of the issues in the middle easy and has completely changed his tune realising it is possible to love your neighbour without endorsing their pedophile cult religion. That's a hopeful sign. We have to win people over one at a time.I'm no devout Christian by a long-shot but Jesus said ""love the sinner hate the sin"". The ""sin"" in this case is Islam. There are plenty of moderate Muslims in the world (though the ""tiny minority of extremists"" narrative is grossly inaccurate in my estimation).....but nowhere in the world is there a ""moderate"" Islam. Even in seemingly moderate countries like Albania and the former Soviet republics in central Asia the overall society itself may be moderate but what they're preaching in the mosques isn't.I once met a very attractive liberal lady at a bar who insisted that the Muslims in the USA were somehow distinct from their counter-parts in the Middle East and that we had no reason to have concerns over them. My response was that ""[if American Muslims seem more moderate than their Middle Eastern counter-parts it's because of one reason only....they are constrained in their capacity to push their religious agenda on the rest of us by our own embedded secular traditions.]""Needless to say my response didn't go down well....and she blew me off.

GuitarWizard90,She has what I like to call “75 IQ face”. She looks like Jessica Simpson in blackface during her awkward fat phase Ha Bad title based on a bad article. The letter admonishing her actions is from a bar association for prosecutors. It has no authority to discipline Kim Foxx. That is up to the IL Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission an agency under the Illinois Supreme Court.  To keep calling this trade professional association the Illinois Bar in the article is very misleading. I wonder if she'll be disbarred One can only hope. Can the charges be brought back or has that shipped sailed and we have to rely on the FBI now? Nope. Double jeopardy is only mentioned by people who have no idea about law; he was never tried on those charges so he could still be on the hook.Of course he's gay black rich and extraordinarily well connected so the odds of that happening are zilch. I mean he did have 19(maybe 16?) felonies on him.. and he took an illegal plea bargain with lawyer consent I mean there’s gonna be outrage if he doesn’t serve like 6 months in jail just for the state crimes if the federal crimes hold up that’ll be another question. The state has the authority to go for like 3-5 years maximum. And since he took a back door plea deal already I highly doubt another would be offered. But I’ve got no idea... just hopefully wishing lol.Edit: and he never admitted to being guilty for the crime which is normally apart of the plea deal..I mean dude is corrupt. I really don’t think he can buy his way out of this now since he literally tried to screw everyone over TWICE. I don't think it's considered a plea deal what he received. Plea deals usually come with an admission of guilt (or at least culpability). There's a I take responsibility but don't believe Im guilty (it's called an Alfred plea I believe). I don't think he even did that. He's in limbo. Grand jury charges but prosecutors are unwilling to prosecute. I've never seen something like this before. That's my understanding as well. A plea deal is formal and probably has steps which involve the court approving it and still imposing sentencing which would be monitored for compliance by whatever state agency.In this case it was an informal agreement where the prosecutors dropped all charges in exchange for 10-18 hours of unsupervised community service and forfeiting the 10000 bail.  It doesn't sound like under IL law a court had to approve this action or any other agency was involved. No no that’s what I’m saying. He took a plea deal without admission of guilt. Is the way it’s been described. I might of fucked that up lol. I’m from bottom side Illinois and it’s literally got everyone in a stir. Haha! We agree then it's insane. I have family on the top side and they're freaking out too. If any impropriety is discovered which this case has plenty of it’s possible that she gets judicial reviewed. Oh no! The Illinois Bar is racist! Illinois Bar Assoc. must do the right thing or forever be known as crooks. Too late Wow. That's a strongly worded letter.

IndefinitePresent,"According to these folks there’s apparently nothing wrong with racism.  I disagree. Well you obviously can't be racist against whites but I agree that it's completely unacceptable to bar Hispanic Asian Arabic or Native American reporters. Reddit has gotten to the point that I can't tell if someone saying ""Well obviously you can't be racist against whites"" is being sarcastic or not... I think the whole /s thing has ruined peoples ability to detect sarcasm and banter. If you have to tell people you're being satirical it kind of defeats the purpose The problem is dumb commenting systems like Reddit where you have unlimited upvotes and downvotes. So people knee-jerk downvote anything that jumps out at them as a different opinion and everyone has to write everything to the lowest common denominator so they don't get downvoted to oblivion (where no one will see your comment again). Similar reason for the ""I hate Trump too but [reasonable comment]"" phenomenon seen in the main subs.If Reddit only gave you a certain number of votes per topic people would be a lot more judicious with them and it'd be easier to get away with thoughtful comments. Apparently a ton of lefties are like that in real life too. They feel the need to start with caveats so as to remain PC. Poes law far predates the whole /s thing though I'm not speaking on that just that there are far too many Redditors who would unironically say ""well obviously you can't be racist against whites"" so it makes it difficult to tell if one is serious or not. And my point was that the obvious sarcasm becomes hard to detect when everyone expects a /s to tell them whether they should be mad or not Could you imagine the hell that would rain down on someone who hung a sign like that saying white press only?  The hypocrisy is mind blowing. They don't want equality. They want their turn in the driver's seat. ""Their turn?"" when did I get my turn?With every passing year I feel less and less able to control things around me. :/ Lol this is exactly it also they were never in ""the back seat"" or whatever. Maybe their grandparents or great grandparents were but not them. This is lunacy and racist. So they can drive it into a ditch and then blame white people. This In a car they didn't build I'm more convinced every year that this was the true reason for the Civil Rights movement.

Political correctness is where the true problem arose. Honestly the answer is to do exactly that and watch the meltdown ensue.  It's the only way to highlight their insane hypocrisy.

How brilliant is Trump!!  With 2020 looming he knows he needs to win the battleground states.   These are the ones Hillary barely campaigned in then lost and blamed the Russians.

Trump has  promised $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative that would benefit 3 of the 5 true battleground states: Michigan Ohio and Pennsylvania.   That gives his a strategic advantage over any opponent in those key states.  It also undercuts the inevitable criticisms from the Left about how Republicans don’t care about the environment.   He scores multiple points with one action.  

Absolutely brilliant!

Rachel Maddow wants to know your location I'm at a barber shop that gives decent hair cuts. She'll never find me there. Sneak 100. The media is responsible for most of the violence and Division in the countryEither the media is a free press which proves that the Free Press is far too dangerous to be unregulatedOr it's not actually a free press and therefore it should be regulatedBut from what we've seen: whatever you want to call it. The media that you're looking at is propaganda and cannot be left to be allowed to say whatever it wants. It needs to be regulated to the point where they can receive fines and other punishments when it's found that they are knowingly and purposely lying The Truth. I don’t watch news too often since it’s mostly:‘Trump Bad!’‘White Supremacy when it’s not even related!’‘Gay People are the victims 100% of the time!’‘BOLD HEADLINES’ That's fine. But lots of people do watch the news and that's why it needs to be dealt wi It’s pretty much made to either stir emotional pots or to gather as many views. Not really about information. Ss: CNN and MSNBC are not news now. They are unregistered illegal super Pacs.they don't report to dues. They simply report whatever the Democrat Party tells them to in whatever way the Democrat Party tells them to report it.Nancy Pelosi after the Russia scandal unraveled immediately went on camera and basically ordered the news networks to stop talking about Russia and start talking about Healthcare. And like dutiful lackeys or like a Super PAC CNN immediately switch gears and withi hours was reporting on Healthcare as if it was a political advertisement. Basically reporting and acting like an advertisement ad for the ACA. Praising the ACA and attacking the GOP. And it wasn't just for one segment. But hour after hour day after day. Are Nancy Pelosi's orders the CNN super-pac immediately started reporting what she wanted.And given what we know from WikiLeaks We know that the Democrat Party has before directly commanded CNN and other news networks what to report. Going as far as writing their articles for them. It's not how news networks behave. News networks might take some cues from different politicians to determine what is most important in the new cycle. News networks might report on what politicians say. But they do not directly take orders from a politician on what to report and how to report it. That's what a Super PAC does. That's what a political campaign does.CNN does not operate or behaves like a News Network. Attack directly like a Super Pac. And it should be forced to register as one and be regulated as The Left is the Democrat party and 90%+ of the media.  They have combined to do all the damage to the American culture. So like...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_MockingbirdHave you heard about this before?  I honestly thought it was super common knowledge. Rachel Maddow can suck it. Imagine crying over the fact your president didn’t commit treason I don't even mean as a joke but why is MSM allowed on internet platforms but Alex Jones etc. is not. People been saying this to be ironic but why are conspiracy theories so bad and need to be banned and if they are why should we treat the Russia truthers any differently. According to their own standards. [ screeches in npc ] They're not wishing he is secretly a Russian agent. They feel that there's enough evidence to suggest that he is a Russian agent and are expecting/hoping that the Mueller investigation was going to confirm it. People did absolutely go as far as that. Regardless I eagerly look forward to your apology when the entire report IS released. Should I hold my breath? It is truly amazing how many people live in an alternate reality where the president is a foreign agent. Think about it. They've had this beating into their heads for going on three years. Then one day--nothing. They are shell shocked right now. They surely still believe it and just think Mueller is also implicated was mislead or whatever. Well done once again poster. Much appreciated.

Yes you re exactly right. We are the destroyers of the planet the apex predators of destruction. All fear white people. Hate to break it to this article but the countries that cause the most damage to the environment have little to no white people in them. This article treats eating certain foods as if it's the only thing that's hurting the environment (and you know not massive amounts of pollution stemming from India China and elsewhere). Then they conflate wealthier people being able to afford pricier food with race. God forbid people are able to enjoy a higher standard of living by paying higher prices to satisfy their preferences. How dare we even let people have preferences in the age of our benevolent central planners? How dare we even have people? You know if there were no people then there'd be no pollution and then everything would be grand right? To all this article” junk” wouldn’t be doing it justice.

BoringLychee7,"It always was. His Comedy Central show was too. The Colbert Report where he pretended to be the Republican pundit to counter Jon Stewart's Daily Show but it was really just more liberal bias where he played the role of a stubborn self righteous conservative caricature.don't know why they couldn't have just actually done that... have a liberal pundit report funny news from their perspective then have another show where a conservative pundit reports funny news from their perspective. you know let people have a balanced look at both sides of any given issue or just choose which show they'd rather watch. don't know why they couldn't have just actually done that...The network wasn't willing to risk confusing their target audience by presenting them with a potentially likable conservative even as a caricature. I know. NBC does it too. look at Ron Swanson from the show Parks & Rec. they have to make sure that the audience knows that he's really a libertarian not a conservative. can't ever just have a likable conservative. Well he's actually for small government so he's really NOT a ""Republican conservative."" Also the reason he resonated with so many people was that he WAS libertarian. Conservatives want less government too. Just like Ron most conservatives think that we shouldn't be taxed for ridiculous social programs that more services should be privatized. Came here to say the same thing.Most late nights shows are. I work night shift in a nursing home and several people watch his show. It drives me nuts to walk past their rooms and hear Colbert's stupid Trump impression.  I don't think I've ever heard him tell a ""joke"" that wasn't about Trump on his show.  I swear the POTUS lives rent free in Colbert's head. 4 year old article. Has been from day 1 Well he tried for a good week to be an actual late night host then quickly realized he's not funny or charismatic enough to stand on his own so he just went back to the same old same old. At least Jon Stewart was funny and coherent. Stewart was also willing to have debates and discussions with people he disagreed with.  He also somewhat regularly called out bullshit from the dems as well.Not saying he wasn't somewhat biased but he was way more level headed than the current generation of late night hosts. I miss those days there was at least a level of respect. Now it's just all vitriol and not even really funny though perhaps that's just me getting older. I don't think it's you just getting older....the late shows have gone from funny and sometimes biased poking fun to basically propaganda shows thats sole focus is to insult the President and his supporters.I've watched late night shows since Clinton and it has never been this overwhelming with bias and propaganda.And the sad thing is that the vitriol and lack of respect comes primarily from the left. Jon Stewart shitting on the dems was him at his best. He was always on point. I never really cared for him. Reddit loved him and all I saw was his bias and people getting their news from his show. He was in big trouble before he went full-on TDS. They were talking about replacing him with the Carpool Karaoke guy. I remember he desperately brought on Jon Stewart and reprised his Colbert Report character trying to get people to give a shit. The only reason he still has a show is Trump. Am I the only one who misses Craig Kilborn the original TDS host? Has become? Where have you been? It’s been that way for a long time I liked him better when he played up his Catholicism.

texasapple,"I live in the Seattle area.It's not just Seattle anymore Tacoma is now also this way so is Renton and many other places. I don't go a single day without seeing drug deals needles and hookers/homeless people everywhere. It's worth a watch and it makes me sad that this is happening to Washington. It's such a beautiful state and we're ruining it. I live near Renton. Renton downtown is bad in some spots but the bigger problem is the rainier valley in general. Seattle's ""solution"" to crime in Belltown was to gentrify it. Knock down all the affordable housing and replace with expensive as fuck condos. So now sure - Belltown is safe. At the cost of everything south. Now everything from Pioneer Square to Beacon Hill down into Tukwila has gone to shit.This video is really spot on. My wife visited Nashville and walked home from a bar at midnight alone - and she felt safe. She can't walk around Pike Place alone after sunset. Seattle is a shithole. So is Tacoma. So is Everett.Edit: and just to point something out: Seattle is the city that has had NUMEROUS violence issues. Mardi Gras WTO riots and a few others. Look up Kris Kime for a real trip down ""wtf lane"". Cops sat on the edges of a violent Mardi Gras crowd doing nothing. A woman's car was flipped and she was assaulted. When a man went to assist her (Kris Kime) he was kicked to death....and police did nothing...because the mayor ordered them to do nothing.) Daughter’s are moving there.  Have yet to experience the underbelly.  But they know Chicago. The difference is you can't get away without leaving the state.There are almost no places without homeless crazies and needles. This is sad.  They are excited for the change in scenery if only for a few years but house hunting was interesting dealing with more than a few sketchy neighborhoods offering “affordable” home prices. Parts of Chicago are the same and likely much worse sans the beautiful scenery. I don't think Chicago literally allows people to smoke meth and shit in public.Also if you call the cops they probably will literally not show up.I called 911 because I heard a guy beating the shit out of a woman in an alley and they never came.If you get a car broken into nobody bothers filing a police report cause it is so common.You can't have a crime rate if nobody responds to crime. To add to this we had someone break into our house and our security system was tripped. It scared the guy off cause a loud alarm blared but it took the cops almost 4 hours to show up. Yeah and I'm not saying ""smoke meth in the woods and you probably won't get caught.""I'm saying literally ""if you smoke meth near Pike Place and a cop walks by literally while smoking meth you will not be arrested."" Yup because it's legal to own 3 grams or less of an illicit substance. It's considered personal use of it even if you do it right in front of everyone. Yup.In WA less than 30 doses of pretty much any drug is legal. Holy hell!There are areas of Chicago where you just don’t want to be...day or night.  But yeah the open homelessness of the type I saw in SF on a trip in February just does not exist in the winter.  However you can smoke weed in public in Chicago without repercussions.  The movie/new report was disturbing and especially with the officials on the dias mocking the citizens. It seems like this is all across the country. I live in a conservative town in a conservative state and I see this shit everywhere still.I'm not saying that these people don't have it rough but we view drug addicts and homeless as victims and not as a problem. There are plenty of charities out there to help these people but hardly any of them utilize it.I think the answer is unfortunately to build more prisons and jails. So many people are arrested and released because they aren't violent offenders. This is the one area where I'm willing to consider though very begrudgingly forced institutionalization.  I mean for people with severe addictions or mental health issues.   Over the years I've talked to a lot of volunteers not for profit people and generally they all seem to agree throwing more money at the issue by itself where the  homeless manage it themselves isn't a long term solution--something else is needed.I realize not all these homeless people fall into those categories where they have really bad mental health issues.  Still not sure there are other reasonable alternatives. I watched this video and Please don't be offended by my question but I honestly cannot understand how or why the government and City officials are being voted in to repeat the same mistakes. why are the citizens not fighting for the right to have a clean safe environment for families for children for everyone.I can not imagine having to walk around smelling and stepping in feces and urine. how in the world has this gone so far.If the citizens of Washington state were really outraged by these horrific conditions please someone explain to me how this is continuing. And how this basically has the look of a third world country.I realize this is a liberal state but seriously the conditions of ratsfeces urine is not healthy. Apathy. Honestly Seattle and Tacoma decide the rest of the state's policies basically. Almost half the population lives in the Seattle area alone. I What happens in Seattle happens in the Seattle area and it effects the rest of the state. Seattle's populace is apathetic and lazy too lazy to care for their city and the ones who aren't are leaving it for other cities or towns or even states.It's basically what happened to California. Liberals move in ruin an area drive up homelessness and drugs then move on to the next state and do the same thing over and over. Like a plague. This is a great watch. I'm in SF and they have the same issues. It's actually made my politics shift significantly right - the government lets people rot away on the street for all to see ignores it and calls that ""compassion"".There's an entire industry around ""homelessness"". They ask for more money every year and liberals who don't want to do any tough work will vote for it so they're ""doing something"" about the issue. The homeless rate never goes down and there are zero visible signs of success. This of course necessitates even more money. Rinse and repeat every damn year.I like the main thesis of the video which is that this is a drug abuse issue. 95% of the problematic homeless on the street are out of their minds on drugs. SF has plenty of homeless services but the people who cause all the problems don't utilize them because they don't allow you to openly shoot up or smoke crack etc.I'm not the only one moving right here - everyone I know who lives here is sick of this shit and openly discusses ways to get rid of the tents and the open drug use. I think there is a window for a Giuliani type to come in with a tough on crime message and clean this shit up. I just wish we hadnt done away with mental institutions. Obviously they had a bad rap because they were run inhumanely but they're necessary in some modernized form. All of the jobs programs in the world won't keep a crazy drug addict or otherwise mentally messed up guy from shitting all over the sidewalk. If SF wanted to raise taxes 1 percent to lock those types up under supervised treatment id be all game. But i suppose that would require national level revisions to laws making that legal again. Completely agree. I'm happy to pay taxes to deal with this but there has to be a specific use for the money with success metrics.As it is now they just passed a bill that increased the homeless budget from $300m/yr to $600m/yr with no actual plan for spending the extra money. Oh there is a plan the plan is to double the wallet size of those who passed the law Yea I don't know who needs to be in charge of fixing issues like this but it sure as shit ain't the city of SF lol. You can kiss that money goodbye. Hundreds of millions of dollars already and we get what... human feces clean up crews? Agree this has been a disaster.

chabanais,I am not interested in funding the olympics period. Special or otherwise. Well the federal government shouldn't be funding education at all.  And it definitely shouldn't be taxing the people of the various states and then passing that money back to those states with strings attached.Education should be funded and the local and state levels and federal taxes should be cut to compensate for the adjustment. For all the chemicals and bullshit the fda allows to be in what kids eat yes they do need to find the special olympics. Huh?Correct me if you’re wrong but are you insinuating the government needs to fund the special olympics because they (the government via the FDA) are allowing hazardous chemicals to be eaten by kids.So in effect the FDA is passively causing people to be eligible for the special olympics so therefore funding the special olympics is reimbursement for the damage they’ve caused?This sounds a lot like “they’re putting chemicals in the water to turn the fricken frogs gay” to me.If I’m incorrect in representing your argument I apologize but this is how it came across when I read it.If you can re-articulate it for clarity that would be appreciated Couldn't this be used as a justification for anything? Yes it literally can.Also its a lefty type of arguement. Why is it the role of the FDA to determine what you eat? Take some responsibility. Why can the French drink wine without sulfites but I cannot? You can... when you buy French wine... French wine in the U.S. contains sulfites. So should I learn about all the different additives in food and drugs so I don't get completely lied to at the supermarket or pharmacy? The FDA is there for a damn good reason. I'm as conservative as the next guy but to say we shouldn't have regulations on food and drugs is a libertarian pipe dream. I don't have the time or the interest in becoming a pharmacist or a chemist both of which the FDA have to ensure that the advil you buy isn't actually rat poison,0,False,t3_b71r3i,10,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b71r3i/betsy_devos_is_right_feds_shouldnt_be_funding/,4,,Betsy DeVos Is Right: Feds Shouldn't Be Funding Special Olympics,4,https://reason.com/blog/2019/03/28/betsy-devos-is-right-feds-shouldnt-be-fu?fbclid=IwAR19SJRKIMli6Ar6LABCn8X9OZ6XPVwtwQvphwmx5ZzhYU1UX5sj8EfhB24

IndefinitePresent,People who already don’t follow the law continue to not follow the law. Does this surprise anyone? We basically have open borders. Story Time!I was an evangelical minister along the Texas border for a couple years and it was common for people to tell you straight up that they were illegal. In fact it was astounding at first how many were either brought as children or cane across as adults. One day I went to visit a family from our congregation (let’s call them the Sanchez). We had a great visit and they invited us over for dinner the following Tuesday. On Sunday thenSanchez family came to church but brother Sanchez wasn’t there. When I asked if he wasn’t feeling well they informed me that he had been deported. I was blown away! I gave my condolences offered comfort asked if the church or I could do anything to help. They just lackadaisically shrugged me off and went about their day. I tried to cancel the dinner but Ms. Sanchez insisted that another minister and I still come over. Well we came over on Tuesday because even though the family looked as though they didn’t care we figured it was just shock. Tuesday rolls around and we knock on their door and who should answer but Mr. Sanchez! We were dumbfounded so we asked what happened. He said “what!? You think they can keep me out of this country?! I’ll just keep paying the right people and I’ll keep coming back”. He thought it was a joke but man I was shocked at how lax the border security was and how little these people worried about deportation.This was just one example of many. Sadly we don’t control the border the Cartels do. I’m a god fearing man who loves all my brothers and sisters and God has always advocated strong borders so there can be prosperity for all even the “strangers who come into your house”. There has got to be a true principle in those teachings since that is a huge focus of God’s interactions with ancient Israel.But what do you guys think? I’m interested since there is so much knowledge I obviously can’t know everything about everything. Hey I’ve recently been getting around to reading the Bible. I’ve read a lot of it but not enough times to remember everything. Would you mind telling me parts of the Bible where advocates for strong borders? Thank you and god bless Well yeah they want to be in America and word of mouth gets around fast if people know they can just get away with it. So when we deport people we don't actually escort them out? Nope. We register them to vote. There are very advanced and intricate networks sending illegals to various parts of the country when they come here illegally. They have lawyers advocating for them and NGO's or nonprofits that are all helping these people. They'll get them housing on public assistance get them entirely settled help find jobs etc. These people actively help to get more illegals settled in the country. Wouldn't be surprised if the cartels aren't sending any money to groups like that that help illegals it's basically an industry at this point.

Part of what makes a justice system just is the ability of prosecutors and judges to use discretion to deal with the corner cases - when the law is broken but there are extenuating circumstances.  You don't put a father away for beating a man to death if it was done in the process of getting that man to stop raping his 3 year old daughter.Smollett was an abuse of that discretion - and it wasn't an isolated case of such abuse it was just very public in an instance where there obviously were no extenuating circumstances and guilt was clear.The result of such abuse over time will be zero-tolerance laws passed that will prevent police from letting people off with a warning prevent prosecutors from dropping criminal charges and prevent judges from going outside sentencing guidelines....and then Barkley is right.  We all lose. Barkley once stated that Auburn didn't hire Turner Gill due to racism. He's usually controversial. Sometimes right and sometimes wrong. He certainly doesn't care either way. This is one of the times he is correct.",0,False,t3_b6m6wr,6,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/b6m6wr/charles_barkley_there_will_be_repercussions_for/,453,,Charles Barkley: There Will Be Repercussions For Smollett Hoax ‘We All Lose’,453,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45240/charles-barkley-there-will-be-repercussions-paul-bois
