If the house were to go ahead with the vote, it passes, goes to the Senate, and gets struck down, it might make future attempts to impeach Trump more difficult even in the face of new evidence or allegations.I feel like Trump is calling for Muller's report to be made public not only as a false posture of strength, but also because the noose is really tightening in on Trump. If the report were made public right now, Trump might have just enough wiggle room to escape indictment and impeachment. I also feel like if this were to happen it would make other investigations into Trump's affairs, like devaluing assets to evade taxes, lose some public support and really rile up the propaganda machines for the upcoming election.Overall, it's not that Pelosi is actively defending Trump. She's a politician playing politics. If we weren't so entrenched in party over country politics, the proceedings would probably already be taking place. However we live in a time where the president can pay a pornstar for sex while his wife is pregnant with his child and still get the overwhelming support of the evangelical vote. Unfortunately for the democratic politicians, they have to impatiently wait for Mueller's findings to come out and hope that there is enough public outcry that republican senators start worrying about their job security in future elections if they don't support impeachment.

At this point I'd be surprised if there is anything that could sway his base or the Senate Republican support.",HempTiger

If you think America doesnt have a race problem you are either racist yourself or blissfully ignorant. As a model minority, asian american, born and raised in this country, i am more american than most but even I am still discriminated against. Sometimes it isnt with ill intentions but prejudices still exist. If I am asian am I automatically good at math, bad at driving and obedient? Not really. But i get treated as such. When we have a president who will not vehemently condemn acts of violence and is willing to stick up for the side that causes violence that is what sparks violence because it shows them that their acts of violence toward liberals, racial minorities, and non trump supporting groups will be accepted.If you dont see what is wrong with Trump in so many ways, you are part of the problem.

And countries that have never embraced liberalism like China and Russia are becoming more powerful internationally, while also becoming more authoritarian at home. The US is retreating from the world stage, and illiberal powers are filling the void.Kagan has a pretty grim world view, where Enlightenment principles are not guaranteed to remain dominant world wide and could even fade in classical liberal strongholds like the US.While I‚Äôm not as pessimistic as Kagan, I think this article is a good reminder that progress is not guaranteed‚Äîeven over the long term.

The song, which borrows its title from N.W.A.‚Äôs ‚ÄúFuck Tha Police,‚Äù name checks officers who had arrested Mal, whose real name is Jamal Knox, for gun and drug possession in 2012 and refers to killing them and other cops.

They target the government as if liberals worship it like they do when their people are in power, and often don't see how it's possible to not worship a god of some kind. With conservatism, you quickly see loyalty and favoritism over qualified people, and valuing punishment and reactions to crisis rather than rehabilitation and problem prevention.I wish there was a better blanket term for the kind of individual brainwashed into a religious, obedient regiment of thinking and tribalism, but it's a consistent chain of traits we see with people around the world regardless of what religion they practice or economic standing. At all times education, documentation, accountability, record keeping, journalism, the right to know, empowering the public are attacked and destroyed.

Prior to the last, what, 10 years vaccines were pretty much standard. Although anti-vax people have like tripled they are still like 1% of the population or something like that. I saw something yesterday but I can't remember the exact numbers.I think this has come from peoples fears that an increasing unvaccinated population would cause measles to spread much faster. I think the push for this is more so to stop the issue before it becomes an issue. Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world. They have made so many advances as far as diseases, that a growing anti-vax population could really screw that up. How about having kids crippled with polio again? I hear that's a lot of fun.The 80% drop in measles deaths from 2000 to 2017 (worldwide) is completely attributed to the vaccination. The problem is other countries don't vaccinate as thoroughly and can travel the world no knowing they are contagious.https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measlesI am torn on this topic because I think anti-vax people are completely detached from reality and putting their children at risk and the rest of the population in general. But I don't really agree with forced inoculation. But I have common sense and would get my children vaccinated, but I don't have kids so take that with a grain of salt.",JesusSquid

We need to start strapping people down and forcing those vaccinations.Seriously though. I am surprised there is not a larger increase in measles deaths in the U.S. Globalization has increased significantly since the 20th century and people from foreign countries are the ones staring all of these outbreaks. Perhaps we need to institute a quarantine period for anyone traveling to the country from a nation with significantly low vaccination levels.

Im Utah we have pretty big wind farms and people buying solar panels for their houses quite often so advancing tech is not relevant to my point. My point is that access to trade breeds big buisseness hubs that middle America just cannot build out of policy alone. The reason middle America had such a strong industrial industry decades ago was because international competition was much slower to pick up on new technologies witch is not a luxury that is available anymore due to the free exchange of information being faster than ever because of communication advancements such as the internet and the market being undercut by subsidiezed industries in places like China. Coastal states were not hit as hard by this change because they are trade hubs that dont need manufacturing to survive.

Giving people the conditions to flourish doesnt really do much unless you invest time,money and effort into the community.However I do not think getting rid of the electoral college is the way to go unless we have a way to give the middle states a fair say in the presidential elections so the coasts do not rule the country.As for the rhetoric of a republican president has not won the popular vote since the 80's is a dangerous rhetoric.

The court is also unique in that article iii gives the court no explicit powers, the court has created all its own powers- the president and congress just agree that they have them and follow them. The court would most likely never rule similarly as they did in Korematsu, simply because they would undermine their own institution‚Äôs legitimacy with the people. The court cannot, however, undermine their own authority because they have the authority that is granted to them through their own rulings. This essentially means whatever they say is law, it‚Äôs just if those rulings aren‚Äôt widely accepted, then people won‚Äôt view them as legitimate and congress and the president won‚Äôt follow them.Full disclosure, I think Korematsu is one of the 5 worst decisions the court has ever handed down. It‚Äôs sickening and wrong. I just have studied constitutional law extensively and understand the legal legitimacy of the decision. I am in no way defending the ruling or advocating its outcome.",DigitalExtinction

Put the phone down, save your dignity, pack your bags and kick rocks. Either they are are an unfaithful asshole or you're a paranoid lunatic. Either way, ending it is best.As for the arguments you describe, those are the bottom of the barrel conservatives. As a rule there aren't any meaningful arguments among the conservatives on social media outside private discussions. Although they are not represented well by their stupid branch on social media, there are a good number of anti-Trump and pro-some stuff Trump conservatives. They don't poke their head out too often because both sides are rabid right now, but I know a few and in spite of my being progressive they are quite nice and highly intelligent. Yeah, even the ones who like Trump. That's because what they like is that he's not a traditional Tea Party GOP president. The ones I know aren't very pleased overall right now because of the lunacy going on, but they make a few interesting points we on the left foolishly ignore.Their arguments summed up (don't hate the messenger).While we can prove any number of high crimes related to obstruction and financial corruption, the narrative we try to sell as Trump being a ""Russian agent"" is fairly silly (this is true). We can prove he used his status in the campaign - and later in the White House - to enrich himself in Russia as a result of people elsewhere no longer wanting to do business with him. He also very likely used the oval office to repay those favors giving government contracts to Russian oligarchs (everyone agrees this happened and he should be removed for it). Once you get past the greed based corruption though the Russia narrative gets thin fast, but the obstruction and corruption are more than enough to remove him from office.Putin hasn't gotten anything directly from the White House, and, in fact, we're in the beginning of a strange standoff over Venezuela and all the oil. The election tampering started well before Trump was a candidate, and we know it was intended to sow division on both sides, not to favor Trump. Putin was happy Trump won because it weakens America, and he's probably gotten a piece of the money from the deal on government contracts. That'll be impossible to prove, but it's a safe bet.As we've been slobbering on ourselves over things like ""collusion"" (which of course there's no such crime in the US code, but that's ok) and our certainty of the outcome, we forget about the worst possible outcome, that the media has been a little irresponsible (as we've seen lately), and we don't get the result we're expecting from the Mueller report. That's the nightmare!All the Senate needs is mild cover of the ""liberal witch hunt"" in the form of Mueller's report not proving beyond any doubt one of the following (these are what ""collusion"" refers to):Criminal conspiracy - (implicit or explicit) agreement between two people to take part in a crime.Aiding and abetting - (accomplice liability): helping someone commit a crime (overt act required).As pointed out to me, both of these are good for everyone who is not willing to support Trump if he committed a provable crime (and us who want him out). That's because each of these covers the people who took part in a crime. Getaway driver is just as liable as the bank robber.You still need to have one criminal act to tie one, or both, of these together. There's no shortage of these, provided we have actionable proof. Defrauding the government will probably be a fairly easy thing to prove, but there's a problem. Mueller's report is very limited in scope. Luckily we have a solid fallback in the Logan Act which would be under his scope of work. Don't forget, just because we know about dozens of crimes doesn't mean they will be included in Mueller's report. It doesn't mean that piece of shit in White House will necessarily have something tied to him.The conservatives closed their argument with something interesting. While almost all of them said they believe Trump should be removed, but they believe (probably correctly) that we've boxed ourselves in. If we don't get actionable evidence from Mueller's report (doesn't matter what we think should happen, only what can happen) Trump will see a huge resurgence from the base by selling the story of the ""witch hunt"" (could happen). If we're successful at removing him we rally republicans around someone more dangerous and more electable in Pence. If the former happens we lose all credibility and we're dead in the water because further investigation by Congress losses us a lot of moderate voters we need in 2020 (again, probably true). If it's the latter we are at a significant disadvantage in electoral math, and we have a religious zealot running the country instead of a corrupt orange imbecile.Plus there's the reality of the Senate not having to hear a trial for articles of impeachment or removal from office, which brings up the ability to indict a sitting president. There's a lot of nuances we love glossing over. We're pretty blinded by justifiable anger right now, but we should prepare for the unlikely, but very real, possibility that report isn't what we think.Sorry it's so long, that's essentially the arguments of intelligent conservatives (endangered but they exist).",C_Chris77
3.0,2.0,https://www.reddit.com//r/Liberal/comments/alc4lm/trump_and_russias_putin_met_again_without_staff.html,"Thanks for your reply,first, regarding the cheating SO analogy, my point was that Trump and his administration have lied about their involvement with Russia and really cant be trusted, as a SO who has lied about involvement with a suspected cheater. It's just an analogy and not a personal anecdote or anything.Furthermore, just because Trump is not a ""russian agent"" does not mean he has not betrayed the interests of America and her Allies by providing support/lifting sanctions to Russia and the Putin regime.With what we know already it doesn't appear he had Americas interests at heart and with all the lying and secrecy surrounding Russia from him, his people, and the GOP it sure doesn't look good.Moving the goalpost to say that ""well he isnt an actual Russian spy"" undermines and disregards the fact that he has not acted with integrity in his role as commander in chief, and the fact that his wreck less decisions (regarding foreign policy related to Rusdia and our alies) have weakened America on the world stage and emboldened Russia.Based on what we already know I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if Trump and many members of the Republican Congress accepted money from or are compromised in some way by Russia and my original comment was to highlight how their behavior indicates something fishy is up and every conservative I talk to pretends like this is business as usual when we all know it's not.",SkunkMonkey420
4.0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com//r/Liberal/comments/alc4lm/trump_and_russias_putin_met_again_without_staff.html,"You're absolutely right about Trump's behavior. Their point to me was about the dangers of the optics and giving Trump a narrative to sell to a group of people who will look for anything to discredit the claims against him. We've been so vocal about Russia for so long that we have a genuine risk of losing the war of the public narrative if Mueller's report doesn't explicitly connect Trump to crimes with actionable findings. That's not moving the goal post, because we've been the ones making those claims of Russian agent status in the MSM and social media for two years.There's no question he should be removed. That's not even up for debate. What they are saying is that the report must be 100% damning evidence of the entire narrative or else we're going to have problems. That's hard to disagree with. Anything less and we end up in a bit of a pickle because we give cover to the Senate to ""justify"" their not hearing the case. We know he's not fit for that office, but that doesn't mean we will end up with actionable evidence to do anything about it. That's where the danger is for us. His base has shown fracturing and a Mueller report that doesn't show explicit evidence of an overt act could be trouble.If you are talking to conservatives who are pretending it's ""business as usual,"" then they are only conservative in the loosest sense of the word. Die hard supporters of Trump are lunatics and unworthy of the time.I was actually agreeing with you on the SO example. I was saying that Mueller's report is our version of ""checking Trump's phone"" to prove he's been unfaithful. It's something we are doing, but we need to remember that the danger of checking someone's phone is that you might not find what you're looking for, and you might get caught not finding evidence of what you're positive is happening. At that point we become the ""bad guy"" for making accusations and not having proof to support it. Even though we know he's guilty, it's about what we can prove. There's a risk, however small, that Mueller's report doesn't provide anything but vindication (in the form of a lack of explicit actionable evidence) to Trump. That's a potentially dangerous situation for us.tl;dr: we definitely need him ousted, but we should be mindful that there's no amount of certainty that Mueller's report will confirm, or be able prove, that he's been cheating on us. This would make us look bad in spite of being right.",C_Chris77

It's completely indefensible.EDIT: Kathy Tran has changed her mind.  She is now saying that she misspoke. Previously, she had answered yes to the question about her bill allowing for an abortion to occur when a woman is in labor and about to give birth. Now she is saying, ""I should have said: 'Clearly, no, because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia, and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth.'"".This indicates a real problem with those liberals who defended what she said. She is saying that her initial statement equated to ""infanticide"" -  directly implying that anyone who defended her comments was defending infanticide. We liberals have to a better job of being honest and fair. We need to listen and think critically. When confronted with a new issue, we need to judge it on its merits and not simply defend a position because it was espoused by another liberal.

The risk of harm isn‚Äôt the only hurdle to include into the limits.

I was working without pay for five weeks as an essential employee (attorney), but the masses didn't seem to care unless there was a direct impact on everyday day people: delayed tax returns, flight delays, etc.You wouldn't believe some of the comments I received, including:""It's just a paid vacation."" (All my leave was canceled because I'm essential, so no.)""It's fine; you're getting paid eventually."" (We had no idea when it would end. My mortgage company didn't have a program in place for government employees, so I was going to face late fees.)""This is what you signed up for."" (If anything, people leave the private sector for the security of government work. Also, no one signs up for a job knowing that they won't get paid on time on a regular basis because Congress or the President can't get their act together.)""Why don't you just not show up? I wouldn't go to work if I weren't being paid to do it."" (This is actually against the law.)It was really quite hurtful. I'm a military veteran, and this was a way of continuing my service. (Also, when I mentioned I had served in the military previously, someone on another subreddit accused me of shooting people in order to go to college for free.)

Many members of Congress (Dems and GOP) had already left town thinking the original temporary measure to fund the government was a done deal. Everyone was taken by surprise by trump's 180. Nevermind trump's own statements about taking responsibility for a shutdown in the days leading up to it.He didn't have any leverage for negotiating. It was a really bad move. All the Dems had to do was keep saying no. How did they think it was going to work out in their favor?,loppsided

He will not give it up because his loudest and dumbest supporters believe he meant that promise and he knows if he caves to Democrats on the wall, he'll look weak to the people who voted for him because he's a ""strongman"". If he falters on this and lets the Alt-White boogyman Nancy Pelosi get the best of him, he has no hope of being reelected. His only hope of not losing whatever wealth he's built up during his time in office and keeping himself & his kids out of prison is a 2nd term.This wall is an issue of survival for him, which is why the shutdown has lasted as long as it has already. By doing a temporary funding of government, Trump is signaling he's acting in good faith (he's not, and we know that) and when he doesn't get his wall the government will shut down again and then it will be pinned on the Democrats. Right now this is Trump's shutdown. Don't give him the opportunity to crawl out from beneath it and drop it on the Democrats. Just hold the line and continue to pick at his insecurities until he blows his stack and you win.The Dems have to force any talk of border security funding to legislation independent from funding the government.

The process of impeachment itself is likely to shift public opinion, both by highlighting what‚Äôs already known and by bringing new evidence to light. If Trump‚Äôs support among Republican voters erodes, his support in the Senate may do the same.Emphasis mine, and I point it out because of how absurdly entrenched partisan support for Trump has been. Republican party support has rarely, if ever, fallen below 80%, so I don't know if I have confidence that actual impeachment proceedings that begin without real damning evidence will actually get that far.But this sort of vote-counting, in any case, misunderstands the point of impeachment. The question of whether impeachment is justified should not be confused with the question of whether it is likely to succeed in removing a president from office. The country will benefit greatly regardless of how the Senate ultimately votes.Again, I think this paints too optimistic a picture of the process. I don't know if the prevailing opinion will be that if impeachment fails, it was worth it to show off the resolve of the constitutional process.",wtfisthisnoise

Most blatantly, Secretary Ross ignored, and violated, a statute that requires him, in circumstances like those here, to collect data through the acquisition and use of ‚Äúadministrative records‚Äù instead of through ‚Äúdirect inquiries‚Äù on a survey such as the census.  Additionally, Secretary Ross‚Äôs decision to add a citizenship question was ‚Äúarbitrary and capricious‚Äù on its own terms: He failed to consider several important aspects of the problem; alternately ignored, cherry-picked, or badly misconstrued the evidence in the record before him; acted irrationally both in light of that evidence and his own stated decisional criteria; and failed to justify significant departures from past policies and practices ‚Äî a veritable smorgasbord of classic, clear-cut APA violations.  On top of that, Secretary Ross acted without observing procedures required by law, including a statute requiring that he notify Congress of the subjects planned for any census at least three years in advance.  And finally, the evidence establishes that Secretary Ross‚Äôs stated rationale, to promote VRA enforcement, was pretextual ‚Äî in other words, that he announced his decision in a manner that concealed its true basis rather than explaining it, as the APA required him to do.  Notably, the Court reaches all of those conclusions based exclusively on the materials in the official ‚ÄúAdministrative Record‚Äù ‚Äî that is, the record of materials collected and submitted by Defendants that Secretary Ross allegedly considered, directly or indirectly, prior to making his decision.  Looking beyond the Administrative Record merely confirms the Court‚Äôs conclusions and illustrates how egregious the APA violations were.",johntempleton

Is self-reliance meant to be an indicator of toxic masculinity?Unfortunately males are going to be overrepresented in violent crime because the most aggressive humans are usually male... this IS a biological determined feature of humanity.Now I am not saying ALL males are more aggressive than ALL females. That is a dumb thing to say. It is not true that ALL males are stronger than ALL females, but in a similar fashion to the fact that the fastest human is going to be Male so the most violent will be. This because the hormones governing physical development also govern psychological development.So even though Men and women are very similar by in large, the small differences result in, at the extremes (think sport), a stacking of one sex versus the other. The fastest female would destroy almost all males in a race, but a female will never be the fastest human because of how the small differences stack at the extremes.

Do you know how many of those jobs could actually be retired with new technologically achievable systems that could save and preserve life?We've got a lot of changing to do, and if progressives like me can't get liberals on board to stop fighting conservatives and just find ways to move on without them...

It‚Äôs a lot more expensive to protect the country when its alone. Letting Canada have a few extra cents for their milk and lumber industries creates a lot of good will that saves a lot of money in other areas like counter intelligence and information sharing. Calling Cananda and the EU an enemy weakens our alliances. Trump revealed a covert Israeli operation where an Israeli had infiltrated ISIS to the fucking Russian foreign minister and proudly told the world he can do that if he wants to.  The imbedded asset had to be warned the he was compromised. This means internal intelligence agencies will tell Trump only the minimum they feel he needs to know, and other countries aren‚Äôt telling the US either. The military also devised a plan to save $125bil of just waste without hurting military readiness but it was buried.

You really can't get around the fact that people in cities generate the most wealth and productivity in the economy and you will find more college educated and open-minded people there.  The more educated someone is the more money they make and taxes they pay, and so the educated end up paying more into the system while high-school dropouts are a drag.

There are requirements built into cartelized situations. Otherwise, why would there be a cartel in the first place?My point is that even excluding any barriers to entry imposed by American political parties (and there are some, though not as many as people think), the system would tend toward two parties by virtue of being a FPTP SMD electoral system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law). It's certainly not absolute, but even assuming a third party sprouted up, it's likely we'd still see two coalitions (left/right) to take the place of the existing big tent parties.The point I was making was more that there is no specific cartelization going on here: it's a natural consequence of the system itself.You use the presidency as the example, which is fair. But that doesn't explain why pretty much every other district in American politics is effectively two party. The M + 1 calculation works pretty effectively in this case. Cartel party theory is far less explanatory for this particular outcome than the simple nature of the system itself. (Interestingly, cartel party theory has some more interesting applications in Western Europe: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/cartel-party-thesis-a-restatement/458996C30EF168AF3A13A3134AA1ACCE and https://ecpr.eu/Filestore/PaperProposal/77c01c49-8fe0-4c5f-a83e-c64362debb30.pdf)I'd make the case that the US is a weaker example of cartel party theory on the grounds that it was never required for the two parties to engage in such behavior: they naturally ended up there by virtue of the electoral system itself.",ExoticCommunication

If your original supplier then becomes less antagonistic it's still probable that you will stick with your replacement supplier otherwise you're just going to piss off two suppliers rather than one.I would therefore, be very surprised if China switches back to US supplies any time soon, even if the 'trade war' is resolved.",EddieMcDowall

I have sympathy for innocent people who suffered from the invasion, but the tal8ban was a state sponsor of terrorism and deserved to be overthrown.And for Iraq, if you ask the Kurds they'll speak well of the us and the invasion generally. So there's that.As for Central and South America, we were combating what were often Soviet backed insurgents. Stopping the Soviet Union spreading was a worthwhile goal.

That god-awful fake smile and the fact that she oozes slime is why. She absolutely fucking disgusted me during the primary debates.I think this is fair. This is my working theory right now. Keep in mind I'm not a cis person so I'm going off what cis women say about themselves.I think that for most of her political life, Hilary Clinton was not allowed to show her true emotions. Politicians in general have to be cagey, but people who aren't white males have to be much more subdued. We all know how Obama would hold it in although he was a master at it in a way (perhaps by, some argue, being excessively naive about the opposition). Women very much aren't allowed to be angry. The debates were very unnerving to me because the discord in her affect reminded me of my abusive mother. But I think that she felt she couldn't show what she really felt about Trump. So she does the long practiced fake smile.I thought about this because I saw the same fake, sarcastic smile on Kamala Harris' face the other day. It was when she was speaking on the anti-lynching legislation and Hyde-Smith, who said she would take a front row seat at a lynching, was presiding. Now some people saw this as sweet irony but I think Harris' demeanor suggests she felt that Hyde-Smith was a disgrace to the Senate and shouldn't be there at all, and it was a personal blow to her to have to put forward this legislation and stay calm and say nothing while Hyde-Smith was presiding. So I worked through my discomfort on Harris' expression because I think it's logical. In the same sense, I think that's a good deal of why Clinton, especially in the debate, dealing with a man who is being actively bullying, following her around and leaning over her, has this bizarre affect. If she reacts, that's ""weakness"" and proof that she, as a woman, doesn't have the stones to lead.",Mr_Conductor_USA

And honestly think about it, when a soldier dies, we do make them martyrs.But even within the military that cult of the soldier is dangerous. Of course any organization that will ask you to kill in their name has to indoctrinate their soldiers that they are somehow superior to the general population. But what actually indoctrinates these young people is the attention they receive from the civilian population.On a lighter note, this reminds me of this clip from curb your enthusiasmhttps://youtu.be/LPquarz16wQ",begemot90

Unfortunately there most powerful emotions are going to be negative: anger, envy, hate, fear, etc., and we're reacting to those emotions.I believe the combination of: false social media realities (what people advertise their own lives to look like online), mass consumer expectations, and income inequality are playing the largest roles in the mass unhappiness if societies around the world: we're being told by different sources that others are happier & have more/better things, yet the harder effort we put into obtaining these false lives/lifestyles, the further away they get.This is really the beginning stages of our natural self destruction, and I'm going to be sure to tell my kids: don't reproduce (as much as I'd love grandchildren) and be selfish with your life.  It's pessimistic but probably realistic as well: today's children will be the last big generation that doesn't suffer.

Do you really not find the education provided by device manufacturers to be useful and what would you like to be done differently? I know the company I worked for would frequently bring in doctors to teach them how to use the products or get feedback (depending on the production stage) and thought it seemed mutually beneficial (but I only saw it from one side).Edit: I may have creeped on your Reddit history and was surprised by how similar your interests are to mine.

That‚Äôs the key question isn‚Äôt it?Absolutely, but I don't really have an answer. I think most (non-military) government research is underfunded and it's not really a NIH-specific problem. I know very few people who are happy with Congress' allocation of funds (no matter their ideology).And let‚Äôs be honest, the ‚Äúeducation‚Äù provided by most device manufacturers is just veiled advertising to try to influence docs to use their stuff.I mean, sure. But I think it's also the best venue to teach physicians to use the devices-I don'tknow how else this could be done feasibly. (I can't comment on the same for pharma.)Why don‚Äôt manufacturers give their education money to the NIH with no strings attached instead?I could be totally wrong here, but I think these are separate issues. I would support the money that is used to fund studies (and thus papers) going to the NIH and then they conduct the studies to (at least attempt) eliminate the bias. However, I'm not sure if the NIH would be amenable to this. (I am also pretty unfamiliar with this process in general, admittedly.)",StoppedLurking-Sorta
