Alcohol does not lead to susceptibility to more dangerous drugs nearly as frequently as marijuana does, as roughly 70% of illicit drug users started with marijuana, per the National Institute of Health. Sure, maybe most marijuana users don't go on to more dangerous drugs, but a significantly larger proportion do than with alcohol. As marijuana has become more acceptable in society, the usage of illicit drugs has increased as well, growing 1.1 percent while marijuana usage has grown 1.7 percent (https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/nationwide-trends?mod=article_inline)This is not coincidental. A former NYPD narcotics detective conducted a study a while back on delinquent youth who were arrested for drug usage, and he later shared with the WSJ that more than 9 out of 10 said they started with marijuana.

I would argue that the reason you see the result you are discussing, is that marijuana is illegal, and alcohol is not. If alcohol were illegal, it would be an easier transition to other illegal drugs since you would already be in that shady world. Law abiding citizens are getting their alcohol at liquor stores, not some alleyway or dimly lit parking lot.I would say that making marijuana legal actually decreases the chances that a user would come into contact with harder substances since there would be a more clear separation.  I believe the biggest contributor to escalating levels is things like the DARE program that I grew up with. They aren't open and honest about drugs. When a person tries alcohol or weed, and realizes they don't immediately become an addict scrambling for their next fix like DARE said they would, they begin to think that DARE lied about all aspects of drugs.

Oppo., at 19. This may be the case for attackers. On the other hand, from the perspective of a victim trying to defend her home and family, the time required to re-load a pistol after the tenth shot might be called a “lethal pause,” as it typically takes a victim much longer to re-load (if they can do it at all) than a perpetrator planning an attack. In other words, the re-loading “pause” the State seeks in hopes of stopping a mass shooter, also tends to create an even more dangerous time for every victim who must try to defend herself with a small-capacity magazine. The need to re-load and the lengthy pause that comes with banning all but small-capacity magazines is especially unforgiving for victims who are disabled, or who have arthritis, or who are trying to hold a phone in their off-hand while attempting to call for police help. The good that a re-loading pause might do in the extremely rare mass shooting incident is vastly outweighed by the harm visited on manifold law-abiding, citizen-victims who must also pause while under attack.Page 74 of the brief: https://d3uwh8jpzww49g.cloudfront.net/sharedmedia/1510684/2064261_2019-03-29-order-granting-plaintiffs_-msj.pdf",Blackneto

In effect, all land in the UK is owned by the crown and in the case of no heir to a plot of land, it is defaulted to the crown.The Norman conquest of England in 1066 saw all land taken under the  ownership of the monarchy. To this day the monarchy - in theory at least  - owns all the land. The Normans changed the ownership of land with the  King giving land as tribute to Norman lords and barons and depriving  the Saxons. The Domesday book was the first audit of land. And the  resulting system of feudalism exacted free labour, goods and produce and  free military service to the land-owning classes for the rest of the  middle ages.The Diggers sought to challenge the ‘Norman Yoake’ and return the  land to common people. As one Diggers’ pamphlet proclaimed ‘Seeing that  the common people of England by joint consent of person and purse have  caste out Charles our Norman oppressor, we have by this victory  recovered ourselves from under this Norman yoake…and the land is to be  held no longer from the use of them [the commoners]’ Their attempts to  build communal farms were persecuted by local landowners and the Diggers  were dispersed. The Diggers obtained nothing from the new Republic  which eagerly sold off Church and Royalist land – the spoils of war – to  its own loyal aristocrats. The redistribution of land was so enormous  that Charles II under the Restoration could not undo the redefined  status quo.From the get-go, it was de facto a case of being so wealthy as to dictate every aspect of a countries day-to-day life and policy both domestic and foreign, that made the monarchy possible.

Did a large swath of registered Democrats come in from other states, in such numbers that it would account for 1/3 of the crowd?Looking again at the state map of who registers parties, it would mean they came pretty far since all of the states bordering Michigan also do not register by party.If still true somehow, it means this number is useless for assessing the trend in Michigan, for one.

Mueller is a corrupt piece of shit.The entire purpose of the special counsel was to remove Trump. They just didn’t count on him being as pure as he actually is.I agree. That doesn't mean that Mueller can just make shit up. That's why he had to nail Flynn and Popadopolis on process crimes. That's why he had to nail Manafort for FARA violations and punt Cohens tax evasion crimes to the Southern District  of New York.Mueller couldn't establish criminal conspiracy aka collusion, not with Trump and not with any former members of his campaign. Mueller had to find process and tax crimes. That's all he had. If Mueller fabricated crimes implicating Trump he would have been investigated himself and would likely serve prison time or at the very least he would have been sued.Do you think Trump would have allowed a fabricated crime that goes far beyond fabricated narratives? Mueller served under the DOJ,  he is subject to DOJ regulations and an AG that is not recused. Even the rat Rosenstein couldn't fabricate a crime, that's why he had to expand the scope of the investigation for Mueller which is still classified.Mueller abused the legal process, Democrats and the media made baseless accusation and ignored the truth. Fake News is still far removed from fake evidence planted by a DOJ appointed special councel. Trump had already established a legal team and forced McCabe and others to resign or step down. GOP swamp dwellers stood by and did nothing and prayed Mueller would find a crime.Impeachment isn't as simple as a vote. The president is entitled to demand all evidence against him, Congress has the right to subpoena look through the evidence before they vote on impeachment. It's essentially a trial in front of Congress. Trump would have buried Mueller is he actually reported crimes in his report that never existed.",Rightquercusalba

Mueller made the process the punishment and desperately searched for a crime to implicate Trump. He didn't find one.If Dems won the Senate Muellers report would remain largely as it is now, lacking collusion and lacking any crime implicating Trump. If Dems won the Senate Mueller would have dragged out the investion longer because he wouldn't have to fear GOP oversight and could have kept digging for crimes unrelated to collusion. A Dem congress would have built upon Muellers investigation and expanded it.But they couldn't establish collusion, if they could just make it up they would have released it right before the midterms so they could win the Senate and hide the corruption. But even then, Mueller serves under the DOJ and impeachment involves a congressional investigation similar to a court case. Even if Dems had Senate control they don't control the impeachment process. Trump would demand their proof, Republicans would demand proof. Mueller would destroy his career and open himself up to prison or being  financially ruined by Trump and his legal team pre and post impeachment.",Rightquercusalba

The image is a low-effort regardless of whatever side you want to look at this from. In any case I wanted to see if this graphic was misleading and try and recreate the data I see from other studies. Most of what I see sourced are from the CDC which has stringent rules in misusing its data (fines, revoking membership, etc.) So it seems like a reasonable starting point. Additionally, what I gather from reading is that the lines that get stretched are the interpretation of gun violence and incorporating children + teens in a single study.I often see teens and children lumped together. For example, if you use studies like ""The Impact of Gun Violence of American Children and Teenagers"" (which many of its sources are via CDC's WISQARS Data Visualization) then you will notice the age ranges are 0-19. You can attempt to recreate the study with CDC's data. I was unsuccessful, but here is the process I followed.Using that study and their visualization tool, you can create a table that would look like:8,295 Homicides Ages 0-19CategoryDeaths per 100kNumber of DeathsTotal1.988,295Black7.65,280American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut1.290White0.92,816Asian, Pacific Islander0.4109Male3.37,033Female0.61,2620-4 Years Old0.32925-9 Years Old0.332110-14 Years Old0.555115-19 Years Old6.87,131So, if we said 0-14 with the idea of children and early teen, then the number is 1,164 deaths over 2013-2017 from homicide. I see gun violence including suicides, so let's go down that route.5,224 Suicides Ages 0-19CategoryDeaths per 100kNumber of DeathsTotal1.255,224Black0.7472American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut1.6118White1.44,503Asian, Pacific Islander0.5131Male2.17,033Female0.31,2620-4 Years Old0.005-9 Years Old0.0310-14 Years Old0.879515-19 Years Old4.24,426At this point if we were to use the numbers from the CDC we would have an average of 9.28 deaths per day for children and teens.Now, if we were to say ""All Intents Firearm deaths"" for ""Children and Teens (Age 0 to 19)"" you would see this table:14,435 Deaths for All Intents Firearm Deaths Ages 0 - 19CategoryDeaths per 100kNumber of DeathsTotal3.4614,435Unintentional0.1559Suicide1.35,224Homicide2.08,295Undetermined0.1228Legal Intervention0.0129Black8.96,079American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut3.2241White2.57,6079Asian, Pacific Islander1.0248Male5.912,366Female1.02,0690-4 Years Old0.54525-9 Years Old0.440510-14 Years Old1.41,47515-19 Years Old11.512,103Alright, this is far as I am going to take it.

The CDC reports there was 54,053 deaths (10,810/year) or for all injury deaths between the ages 0-19. The age group of 0-14 is 22,539 deaths (4,507/year).

Without the electoral college and Senate we'd be screwed.

It’s hard to explain. A little backstory: I’m white. I’m half European (British, Irish, German, French) and half Middle Eastern (Iranian and Armenian). My mom’s family (European) is just like your family, we’ve been here for a LONG time. My dad’s family (Middle Eastern) hasn’t been here very long. My father is a first-generation American. He was bullied and treated like shit during the Iranian Hostage Crisis. The reason I don’t call myself British-American or German-American but like to say Iranian-American or Armenian-American is because I’ve never been picked on for being British or German or whatever, but have been called a “FUCKING TERRORIST” and “FUCKING MUSLIM” a billion times. It’s hard to explain, but it’s more of a pride thing. I’m Middle Eastern, AND I’m American. I remember when I was in first grade and some other kids found out I was Middle Eastern and they started shouting that I was “ FOREIGN”, and not American. Do you see what I mean?I have an interesting ability to be able to see both sides of the coin. Since I blend in with white people (I mean, really white people like Europeans) and everybody assumes I’m Italian or Jewish, I know what it’s like to be called a “RACIST TRUMP SUPPORTER” and be called our for having “WHITE PRIVILEGE”. But, on the other hand, when people learn I’m half Middle Eastern they completely change their tune. I’m now an Uncle Tom for my kind.Really, at the end of the day, race/ethnicity is bullshit.

1.0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com//r/Conservative/comments/b7pi8c/court_blocks_trump_effort_to_open_arctic_waters.html,"A federal judge in Alaska has reinstated a ban on oil-and-gas drilling in vast swaths of the Arctic Ocean, potentially undermining a central part of the Trump administration’s effort to expand offshore drilling.Mr. Trump will need congressional authority, according to the ruling, to reopen drilling in Arctic areas and smaller parts of the Atlantic Ocean that the Obama administration put off limits just weeks before President Obama left office. The late Friday ruling invalidates an executive order Mr. Trump issued during his first months in office aimed to overturning the ban.There is no ongoing commercial drilling in those areas, and the Alaskan oil industry has been hampered by low oil prices for years, limiting the immediate effects from the ruling. But it does raise questions about a long-awaited overhaul of the country’s offshore drilling plan the Trump administration was expected to issue in the coming weeks.The Trump administration had proposed opening offshore areas around the country, including almost all of offshore Alaska. Though the draft proposal faced stiff opposition from several coastal states and environmental groups, an Arctic expansion had wide support from Alaskan leaders hoping for a revival and an oil industry interested in expanding its options.“This is a great victory for the Arctic, its polar bears, other wildlife and communities. It’s absolutely the right outcome under the law and for the sake of our planet,” said Kristen Monsell, a senior attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit challenging the Trump administration.A spokeswoman for the Interior Department said the department doesn’t comment on ongoing litigation.“From a long-term perspective, it is a central area when it comes to our energy policy and future energy production,” said Erik Milito of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil-and-gas industry trade association that was a party to the case.Friday’s ruling focuses on about 125 million acres of the U.S. Arctic Ocean and 3.8 million acres of the Atlantic Ocean, the latter focused on offshore areas from Maryland to Massachusetts. The decision to block drilling there came as part of a wave of last-minute environmental actions from Mr. Obama to “preserve a healthy Arctic ecosystem and protect our fragile Arctic waters,” Mr. Obama said at the time.Mr. Trump issued an order in 2017 to overturn Mr. Obama’s action, part of his agenda to boost domestic energy production. But legal experts and analysts had warned that he may not have the power to overturn the ban under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.U.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason agreed. That 1953 law includes a sentence saying the president may “from time to time, withdraw” from consideration any currently unleased lands in federal offshore waters. It has been invoked only a handful of times and doesn’t include a procedure for a new president to undo actions by a predecessor.Judge Gleason ruled that Congress had passed other laws that clearly authorized a president to revoke the decisions of a predecessor. This law had not, she said, concluding Mr. Trump didn’t have that authority.The decision could face appeal. If it isn’t overturned, it would require Congress to act to open up many offshore areas the Trump administration had included as part of its expansion. That appears unlikely at a time when Democrats have control of the House and have prioritized climate-change policies to limit fossil-fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.",ReaganTroll

No mention of homosexuality, lgbtq, gay, or any other keyword. It simply defines how they see marriage and sexual activity as between one man and one woman. They must hate Mormons by this definition, but I’m sure ThinkProgress isn’t concerned with that or won’t try to spin it that way.Staff and volunteers with the organization have been required to adhere to a strict “sexual purity” policy, prohibiting any “homosexual acts,” even for married couples.Well, duh? They are a Christian organization teaching Christian morals. Those include sexual purity. The link here takes you to fca Austin’s document  which reads:FCA’s Sexual Purity Statement God desires His children to lead pure lives of holiness. The Bible is clear in teaching on sexual sin including sex outside of marriage and homosexual acts. Neither heterosexual sex outside of marriage nor any homosexual act constitute an alternative lifestyle acceptable to God.Pure hatred, right? I mean, this is literally calling for the stoning of gays in the streets, isn’t it?No. It’s saying, “You want to be part of our private organization, you abide by our rules.” That’s it. No hate. No violence. Not even close to the leftist bullshit they are pushing simply because Chick-Fil-A is founded on Christian principles.And that is all this is, folks. If the left wants to win, they know they have to dismantle every traditional facet of society. Anything hat harkens back to a time before must be destroyed. That includes marriage, family, and especially religion. Your god must be the state and no other. And the lgbtqaip+&@ agenda is their linchpin argument. They are losing the abortion fight, so this is where they put their stock.Anything that holds to traditional marriage is deemed “hateful” and “harmful” to society. Anything that teaches sexual purity or even disagrees with homosexuality is “violence” to gays. Never mind that Christianity teaches “love your neighbor as yourself” and “let he who is without sin cast the first stone”.",justhere2havefun

None of those endgoals will be fulfilled for good reason. This unlevel playing field argument evaporates before the facts: since 1981, when the United States last enjoyed a surplus in the trade of manufactured goods, the levels of protection have not changed much (except in the United States, where it has gone up). As for Japan, reputedly our most unfair trading partner, its proportion of the U.S. trade deficit hardly grew at all from 1981 to 1985. Protectionists usually couch their claims in terms of saving particular industries from imports, as with shoes, lumber, and steel pipe. The facts show, however, that tariffs and quotas seldom save jobs for long or preserve the competitiveness of the industry to be “saved.” Meanwhile, of course, the consumer suffers through higher prices. While subsidies, tariffs, and similar practices affect the mix of trade over the medium run, they do not affect the trade balance, which is driven by a nation’s spending and saving patterns. A country with investment opportunities exceeding its domestic savings will borrow from abroad and run a trade deficit even if its costs are relatively low, its home markets protected, and its exports subsidized. Conversely, a nation with high savings relative to investment will run a trade surplus even if its markets are open and its products sell poorly. The recent deterioration in the U.S. trade position resulted from the decline in net national saving when the growing budget deficit far outstripped any increase in net private saving.It is not the purpose of government to interfere with individual transactions and agreements that make up the U.S. economy or the global economy. The government cannot predict the future actions of the millions of individuals whom make up an economy, Tariffs are taxes. Taxes reduce consumption and make life worse for consumers, who are also producers in other industries. The government is not a magical god with the capacity to correctly predict which industries are worth preserving.

This was done through exporting, and is still reliant on exporting.There is also evidence that China has lost its comparative advantage in much of its trade, and that continued production is do to momentum and fixed capital in China.

My story is a sad one.A lot of people don't realize this, but there's a reason why Trump was elected against all the odds against him (arguably unqualified, volatile, untested, risky), and a big part of that is the legacy of 2008.  We no longer believed either party could help us, because they're all insiders looking after the interests of insiders.  Only a true outsider could help.That's why we saw hope in Trump.  Yes, he says wacky things, and that's part of his charm to me anyway, but we needed someone to shake up the establishment system.  And that's exactly what he's done, to the limits of his abilities, despite the best efforts of the CIA and the corrupt deep state to stage a soft coup against him.But his job is far from done.  We still need concrete immigration reform and to finish the wall.  This country cannot survive in it's current form given the onslaught of illegal and legal immigration that we're subjected to on a yearly basis.  Obama's promise of fundamental transformation is still very much a future reality as long as the flood gates of people yearning to vote for socialism keep flooding into this country.  Ocasio-Cortez is not a temporary aberration, she is rising and others will rise like her unless we shut the doors and begin the difficult and time consuming process of assimilation of 10's of millions of foreign born here who do not comprehend why this place is so special (and their home countries they fled from are not).",Reven1911

People in society are both the wolves and the sheep, with the logic being that the law-abiding citizens will voluntarily restrict themselves while the criminals (wolves) will just ignore that restriction.Second, there is absolutely no correlation between how many guns someone owns and how likely they are to commit crime. The vast majority of ""stockpilers"" won't commit crimes, and the vast majority of crimes are committed by people who only own one or two guns - or even none at all (obtaining them from a different source, ie. most of the recent school shootings were done by people who accessed improperly stored guns)third, the idea that a government database and algorithm will somehow stop crime... somehow. The idea of the government even putting together an effective system for it is asinine, and even if it did work, it would almost immediately be abused.Finally, the big one: the supposition that gun crime is primarily a mental health issue. Flat. Out. Wrong. Mental health is an important issue, and there are some high profile cases of violent crime related to mental health, but ""mental illness"" does not explain the high rate of violent crime outside of the mass shooting we see in the media. Do you really think depression is what is causing the violence epidemic in Chicago? Or could there be other factors, maybe, i dunno, not enough positive role models, poor education, lack of economic opportunity and mobility, poverty, a culture of violence and gang affiliation, and a fundamental lack of moral guidance in the lives of young men?",dicaparly

1.0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com//r/Conservative/comments/b7ealw/us_stocks_rise_notching_best_quarter_since_the.html,"U.S. stocks notched their biggest quarterly gains in nearly a decade, lifted by bets that central banks would hold interest rates at low levels as global growth slows.Major indexes have now recouped almost all of the losses they suffered in the final months of 2018, when fears about an economic downturn sent markets around the world sliding.Much of this year’s rally was fueled by relief that central banks were willing to back off their rate-increase campaigns after growth cooled from the eurozone to China and stocks swooned, investors and analysts said. Others attributed part of the rebound to investors stepping back into stocks after a selloff that many considered overdone.The market’s turnaround has helped whet investors’ appetite for what many believe could be one of the biggest years ever for IPOs. On Friday, shares of ride-hailing firm Lyft Inc. rose 8.7% in their trading debut.Many believe the U.S. economy continues to be a relative bright spot around the world. Still, indications that inflation remains muted have helped push the Federal Reserve to pause its rate-increase campaign. Some have called for the Fed to go even further: National Economic Council Director Lawrence Kudlow said Friday the Fed should lower its benchmark federal-funds rate by 50 basis points to help protect the U.S. economy.“Central bankers are finally catching up with not just the economic data, but also the expectations” of investors, said Mike Ryan, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management. That is a reversal from the fourth quarter, when many investors feared the Fed’s plans at the time to continue raising rates in 2019 might tip a slowing economy into a downturn.The S&P 500 added 13% for the quarter, its best showing since 2009, and rose 0.7% to 2834.40 on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday jumped 211.22 points, or 0.8%, to 25928.68, finishing the quarter up 11%. The Nasdaq Composite rose 60.16 points, or 0.8%, to 7729.32 and added 16% for the quarter.Gains were broad, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors ending higher for the quarter for the first time since 2014.Technology shares extended a streak of gains that have made them the strongest-performing sector in the S&P 500 this year. Facebook Inc. and Netflix Inc. rose 27% and 33%, respectively, in the first quarter. Signs that profits continue to boom among technology-focused companies have helped drive share prices higher.Another standout in the first quarter: energy stocks. Shares of companies like Hess Corp. and Devon Energy Corp. soared more than 40%, boosted by rising oil prices.Despite the rally of the past couple months, U.S. stock indexes have yet to climb above the highs they hit last fall. Major indexes have flitted close to records, only to retreat as fears about cooling economic momentum sparked a slide across stocks, commodities and bond yields.The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note—considered a bedrock for global finance because it is used to help set borrowing costs—settled at 2.416% Friday, up slightly from Thursday but well below the 2.684% where it ended last year.Yields, which fall as bond prices rise, have retreated around the world in recent weeks, underscoring the tug of war investors say they are facing.Central banks’ softer approach to monetary policy this year has reassured investors that borrowing costs, which can feed into corporate profits and consumer spending, are unlikely to race out of control. Yet the sustained slide in bond yields throughout the quarter has left some investors wondering if stocks’ first-quarter rally is on shaky ground.One point of concern is that U.S. stocks’ banner first quarter has put major indexes above the point where some analysts had expected them to end the year. With economic growth cooling, some investors question if a strong catalyst will emerge to churn stocks higher.“We’re not anticipating that we’re going to see a big enough earnings surprise to boost stock prices much higher than they are now,” said Tracie McMillion, head of global asset-allocation strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute.Some fund managers have also been unsettled by the disconnect between the stock and bond markets throughout the year. Stocks and bond yields typically rise in tandem—not diverge—when investors are confident about prospects for economic growth.“My hope is that the economy can grow out of this and give central banks some extended period of time to refocus,” said Dan Miller, director of equities at GW&K Investment Management.Mr. Miller is optimistic U.S. stocks can continue to carve out gains, but he is wary of risks like continuing trade talks between the U.S. and China, uncertainty over Brexit and a further pullback in growth in the eurozone.“There’s a lot of cross currents that are out there,” he added.",ReaganTroll

2.0,16.0,https://www.reddit.com//r/Conservative/comments/b6xewu/kim_foxx_will_and_should_lose_her_job_over_the.html,"ook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx probably will and arguably should lose her job next year over her office’s handling of the Jussie Smollett case.Yes, there are many worse crimes committed every day in Chicago than staging a hate-inspired attack and filing a false police report about it — the offense with which Smollett was charged. And no, justice did not demand that Smollett be shackled and shipped off to prison for allegedly orchestrating a stunt.But justice demanded resolution and accountability. And Foxx appeared oblivious to this imperative as she made the media rounds attempting to explain why her office sent Smollett on his merry way Tuesday morning without extracting an admission of guilt or collecting a meaningful fine.Her tone-deaf statements included equating Smollett to the raft of no-name, low-level, nonviolent offenders who have received the “go and sin no more” treatment, and patronizing those who are outraged by the outcome as “people who don’t understand the intricacies of the justice system.”Here’s what we understand: High-profile criminal cases are the lens through which the public sees and evaluates the administration of justice as a whole.Is the alleged crime investigated thoroughly and honestly? Is the process of obtaining an outcome transparent and fair? Does the result give us confidence that all the low-profile cases most of us never hear of are being handled with integrity?Smollett’s claim was high-profile because he’s a celebrity — a star of TV’s “Empire” — and because he alleged that his attackers evoked President Donald Trump, used racial and homophobic slurs and deployed a noose in giving him a light beating on a Streeterville sidewalk in the wee hours of Jan. 29.The claim got national attention and put pressure on the Chicago Police Department to track down the perpetrators or else risk looking indifferent to a disturbing battery against a prominent African-American gay man.And when Smollett’s claim unraveled and authorities alleged he and two acquaintances had faked the whole thing, the pressure shifted onto the Cook County state’s attorney’s office. Foxx and her team had to demonstrate that they take seriously the social damage caused by invented hate crimes, particularly ones that command significant investigatory resources.It was a fairly basic task. They failed spectacularly.The process that brought a surprise end to the case was anything but transparent. Prosecutors didn’t even alert reporters to the “emergency” hearing where they dropped, without explanation, all 16 felony disorderly conduct charges, and where they didn’t object to the sealing of the court file.And although prosecutors got Smollett to forfeit his bond of $10,000 — not much of a dent in the budget of an actor who reportedly makes more than 10 times that amount per episode of “Empire” — they did not even ask for a confession or apology.That allowed Smollett to repair immediately to the courthouse lobby and preen for the cameras about his innocence.His lawyers have since repeatedly echoed this claim, for example responding Thursday to the city’s demand that Smollett pay the cost of the investigation, later estimated at $130,000, with a statement saying, “It is the mayor and the police chief who owe Jussie — owe him an apology — for dragging an innocent man’s character through the mud. Jussie has paid enough.”Such galling pieties have infuriated all of us who wanted to see the accused selfish charlatan humbled and fined for allegedly perpetrating such an ugly hoax.Had the case against him fallen apart? That would have been a passable explanation given that witnesses do disappear or change their stories. But no, prosecutors expressed continued confidence in their ability to have proved Smollett guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.Had prosecutors told themselves that a blindsided public would be satisfied by the, “Oh, we do this a lot” explanation of an abrupt dismissal of charges in a sensational case? Not unless they’re extremely dense.Foxx could have distanced herself from this blunder given that her own blunder — emailing and texting with people close to Smollett early in the investigation — had prompted her to step away from the case and leave it to underlings. But she grabbed ownership of it Wednesday, giving interviews in which she expressed pride and confidence in the way her office had handled the case.And although she can point with some pride to the diversionary programs that have kept small-time offenders out of jail and offered them fresh starts and clean states, her betrayal of the public’s understandable expectations of justice in the Smollett case will taint that entire initiative. Both the National District Attorneys Association and the Illinois Prosecutors Bar Association have released statements this week sharply critical of Foxx.She will be defending this deeply disappointing outcome from now until at least March 17, 2020. That’s the date of the primary election in which she is now certain to face a Democratic challenger for the office whose ideals she has disgraced.",idle19

But she was recovering from surgery to remove a tumor, and the former House speaker admits that they “got into an argument.”FULL QUESTIONDid Newt Gingrich ask his former wife to sign divorce papers on her deathbed?FULL ANSWERFor almost three decades, Newt Gingrich has been dogged by a story that he served his first wife divorce papers while she lay in a hospital bed battling — or in some versions dying from — cancer. It didn’t happen that way.In fact, Gingrich, the presidential candidate and former House speaker, and his first wife, Jackie Battley, had already separated before she was hospitalized. He had filed for divorce, and she was seeking alimony and custody of their two children. And while Battley had earlier undergone cancer surgery, this time she was in the hospital recovering from surgery to remove a tumor that — according to one of the couple’s daughters — was benign. Battley isn’t talking to reporters, but she’s still very much alive.",Browse_ONLY87

Almost every conservative I know has always wanted greater transparency in government regardless of who is sitting at the table so that citizens can be informed of government action or inaction.Not that I would say the democrats/liberals wants to operate in complete secrecy but I’ve generally noticed that federal transparency is less important to democrats in favor of a more “need-to-know” basis (just my anecdotal experience). Which had a lot to do with both of the Clinton’s downfalls.Seriously though, when did that change? Are conservatives now in favor of less transparency for the people to form their own opinion? Essentially having someone provide them information based on the narrative of whoever is sitting at the desk. No thanks man, I’d rather have the redacted report instead of someone’s personal summarization of the report. Also, before someone says it yes, I know certain things need to be blinded to protect future legal proceedings but it should be released as soon as humanly possible.Not to mention, when has illegal or unethical acts in government been something conservatives are okay with? Those are things that should be known and talked about. Sure I agree, petty political bullshit isn’t important, but if my congressman is doing something illegal or unethical I damn well want to know about it. It troubles me that some of the conservatives in this thread are now “okay” with leadership performing illegal or unethical actions just because democrats are going to “magnify” it. We literally did the exact same thing when Obama was president and quite a bit of it was justified but not every issue was “illegal”, yet it was still discussed and criticized.

1.0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com//r/Conservative/comments/b7ed0w/utah_allowed_to_limit_voterapproved_medicaid.html,"WASHINGTON—Utah will be able to limit its expansion of Medicaid under a decision from the Trump administration that falls short of a broadening of eligibility that the state’s voters had approved last year.Voters in the November midterm elections had approved a full expansion under the Affordable Care Act that was projected to result in more than 120,000 people gaining coverage.But state lawmakers in the Republican-led legislature asked the federal government to let Utah pursue a more scaled-back expansion that would cover an estimated 50,000 fewer people.The program approved Friday by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will serve as a bridge for one year, when the federal government could increase its share of costs for the expansion, per request from the state. Utah also got approval to impose work requirements but state officials said that won’t begin until 2020.Utah is also the first state to get approval to cap enrollment if there are insufficient state funds available to match the federal funds.For the first year of the program’s expansion, which starts April 1, the federal government will cover about 70% of the cost; Utah will cover the remaining 30%, state officials said.If the Trump administration lets the state keep its partial expansion but increases its share of the cost to 90%, which Utah officials have requested, it could be significant. Other Republican-led states that haven’t increased their Medicaid program under the ACA may then also pursue a partial expansion with the more robust federal funding. Some state officials have said that would be less of a financial burden than a full expansion.Alternatively, states with a full expansion could also seek to pare it back. The state-federal program for the low income and the disabled has swelled under the ACA, with 37 states and Washington, D.C., having expanded Medicaid.Supporters of the November referendum to expand Medicaid in Utah had criticized the legislature’s decision to seek only the partial expansion.“The legislature is trampling on the clear will of the voters, and it’s stripping tens of thousands of Utahns of access to care in the process,” Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project, said in late February. The organization finances and supports Medicaid expansion efforts in states.Medicaid expansion under the ACA has turned into a fierce battle as GOP-led states get first-ever approvals for limits on the program from the Trump administration, which recently saw a major set back in its backing of such restrictions. A federal judge on Wednesday invalidated Medicaid work requirements in Arkansas and Kentucky, dealing a blow to the Trump administration’s attempts to remold the safety-net health program.The decision blocked Arkansas from continuing to enforce its work requirement, which has resulted in 18,000 residents there falling off Medicaid rolls since the state implemented the work mandates in June. It also prevents Kentucky’s work requirement from taking effect, which it was set to do on April 1.Critics say work requirements and enrollment caps on Medicaid expansion are part of a Republican effort to limit or take away coverage. Supporters argue that the requirements, which often permit beneficiaries to do community service or schooling instead of work, help people become employed where they can obtain health coverage on the job.“It isn’t easy to design a program that cares for the whole needs of a person, including the social determinants that we know have such a large impact on health like work and community engagement,” said CMS Administrator Seema Verma. She said Utah’s government has developed a sustainable solution to help lift families out of poverty.",ReaganTroll

Prior to the mid-90's the Dems had what was essentially a monopoly on Congress. From Wiki:The gains in seats in the mid-term election resulted in the Republicans gaining control of both the House and the Senate in January 1995. Republicans had not held the majority in the House for forty years, since the 83rd Congress (elected in 1952). Republicans only controlled 4 years of both House and Senate from 1933 to 1995.Prior to this, Tip ran the house like a good ole boy club.  He'd let his boys do some things, and if the Republicans toted the line he'd let them play also.  Newt went around Tip and took his message to the people and really pissed Tip off.This pretty much solidified the establishment of the American political duopoly.  Both sides were polarized, but both sides keep other options out.http://freakonomics.com/podcast/politics-industry/",UEMcGill

I'm not sure it was any one event, or even a tit for tat back and forth where each side escalated.  It seems probable the division was happening for other reasons. For example, social media/internet/like minded groups reinforcing and and radicalizing their beliefs, while removing any element which required compromise by allowing people to avoid the opposite side(s).Today, it's something like less than 40% of shared interests between both main parties.",Roez

We chose to go forward and let God decide.Weeks later our baby was born. He was failing in utero and was barely responding.   The docs went in with a c section and pulled him out.

Because of my wife's high risk pregnancies, we look at about day 21 (so a week after a missed period or 5 weeks pregnant). We have go to the hospital to the specialist ultrasound machine because the one in the OB office can't see the baby at that stage. But I mean, by around that time, there is a clear orientation to the body and an unmistakable heartbeat. We were really nervous the last time and the ultrasound tech saw we were nervous. She found the heartbeat, but because she's a tech wasn't allowed to give us the 'diagnosis' of a heartbeat. Instead, she turned the screen to us and told us, ""I can't tell you what you're looking at, but I think you know.""We knew... it's pretty obvious on a good machine.To be clear, by the time a child has embedded in the uterus (around day 9-12), it's already about multicellular, and it more than doubles each day. When we saw our daughter, it would have been hundreds of thousands of cells making up her body.To the actual point of the question. Honestly, babies are cheap (or at least do not get expensive until many years after birth), and rewarding. Most states will give you a lot of medical aide if you are pregnant and have no or little income (or at least they should). You got the girl pregnant. Step up and do your duty as father.

He had had multiple meeting with foreigners as the incoming NSA. The FBI told him he didn't need a lawyer, they left the impression that this was just a routine questioning.

It's possible to not recall a conversation accurately and not be lying. Flynn had that conversation with the Russian ambassador while he was out of the country and on vacation. He had had multiple conversation with numerous ambassadors and diplomats during the transition period as Trump's National Security advisor.You can read the transcript of the conversation which didn't indicate anything was out of the ordinary when Flynn spoke with the ambassador. What he did was 100% legal and part of his job. That's why when the FBI spoke to Flynn his guard wasn't up, he didn't request a lawyer, he was being friendly and cooperative with the agents.When asked about the conversation, he said he didn't have a conversation about sanctions. He could have easily been mistaken and didn't remember fully. His answers didn't match up to a transcript of the phone conversation, Flynn was being spied on. That's the  big fucking deal not  that he didn't answer the way the witch hunters wanted.The Russian investigation was a hoax. It was a scam in 2016 and it was a scam when Mueller was investigating it. Flynn was charged by Mueller when Mueller had nothing to do with Flynn being questioned by the FBI. Everyone that wasn't linked to Trump got free passes out of their proven lies. Meanwhile Flynn,  despite fully cooperating, was made an example of by Mueller. He decided to hang him over a dubious and questionable claim of lies that even the FBI agents didn't believe were lies. That shows that Mueller targeted Flynn for political reasons.

Lethality is Not the TestSome say that the use of “large capacity magazines” increases the lethality of gun violence. They point out that when large capacity magazines are used in mass shootings, more shots are fired, more people are wounded, and more wounds are fatal than in other mass shootings. That may or may not be true. Certainly, a gun when abused is lethal. A gun holding more than 10 rounds is lethal to more people than a gun holding less than 10 rounds, but it is not constitutionally decisive. Nothing in the Second Amendment makes lethality a factor to consider because a gun’s lethality, or dangerousness, is assumed. The Second Amendment does not exist to protect the right to bear down pillows and foam baseball bats. It protects guns and every gun is dangerous. “If Heller tells us anything, it is that firearms cannot be categorically prohibited just because they are dangerous.” Caetano v. Massachusetts, 136 S. Ct. 1027, 1031 (2016) (Alito, J. and Thomas, J., concurring); Maloney v. Singas, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211546 *19 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 14, 2018) (striking down 1974 ban on possession of dangerous nunchaku in violation of the Second Amendment and quoting Caetano). “[T]he relative dangerousness of a weapon is irrelevant when the weapon belongs to a class of arms commonly used for lawful purposes.” Id.California law presently permits the lethality of a gun with a 10-round magazine. In other words, a gun with an 11-round magazine or a 15-round magazine is apparently too lethal to be possessed by a law-abiding citizen. A gun with a 10-round magazine is not. Missing is a constitutionally-permissible standard for testing acceptable lethality. The Attorney General offers no objective standard. Heller sets out a commonality standard that can be applied to magazine hardware: is the size of the magazine “common”? If so, the size is constitutionally-protected.If the “too lethal” standard is followed to its logical conclusion, the government may dictate in the future that a magazine of eight rounds is too lethal. And after that, it may dictate that a gun with a magazine holding three rounds is too lethal since a person usually fires only 2.2 rounds in self-defense. This stepped-down approach may continue32 until the time comes when government declares that only guns holding a single round are sufficiently lacking in lethality that they are both “safe” to possess and powerful enough to provide a means of self-defense.",BlckHispPoor-but-OK

Look at any graph they post that “proves” Global warming, it’s usually always skewed to hell and the y-axis is amplified so that your looking at hundredths of a percent change and the category is some super specific sub field. Case in point, i had a local weatherface post some graphic on his Facebook about the date of first frost getting later and later from the 1890’s on. Of course, he never actually “said” he was blaming climate change. So looking at the data, generally everything fell between the last week of October and second week of November (because winter starts in the third week of December...). At first glance, it looks so alarming, “OMG THE GRAPHS SHOOTS UP AT THE END!” Except, there were 3 cycles displayed in that 120 years, the last being a downsloping one that ended around 1980, then the dates began to rise after that. I pointed out the fear mongering he was using and he responded “if you don’t see that the dates are CLEARLY getting later I don’t know what to tell you”. You could run a laser level through that graphic and it would show and equilibrium, with there having been 2 outliers on either side. By the way, after that i notated that our first frost was November 7, right in the middle of the trend.I’m not smart enough to know if the world is heating or cooling, but I’m not arrogant enough to say that humanity has more of an impact than millennia of climate cycling, sun cycling, volcanic activity, especially without factoring in big pieces like global shipping, indoor climate controls (if we artificially heat our homes for the last 100 years, that energy eventually goes somewhere), or even that the data is skewed because most of it comes from cities which suffer from the urban heat effect (a completely separate phenomenon.

Bison are larger and far more active than cattle, meaning they would need to eat as much or more than our current dairy and beef cattle. There are around 100 million cattle in the US right now, therefore methane emission from livestock have remained essentially the same over the last century, the source has shifted a bit. India holds 250 million cattle...over 25% of the world's population.While climate change isn't something that can be denied, it is also something that we can't do anything about, be it making things worse or better. Average global surface temperature since 1880 has risen at a linear rate a grand total of 0.8 degrees with no acceleration with the dawn of industry. Average ocean temperature has risen 0.7 degrees in the same span. When Antarctica's average temperature is in the range of -10 (warmest part) to -75 (coldest part) (-25 to -50 most common range), less than 1 degree is not going to amount to much.

But let me ask you something.What will more likely lead to an unwanted pregnancy?Telling a teenager to have promiscuous sex with whomever they want, whenever they want (and promise abortion) [and they have sex 4 days a week] or teaching a kid to practice abstinence (they’re not perfect, but they decrease the amount to twice a month)?It’s a simple numbers game, not even a religious argument. Yet, the left doesn’t want to hear it. They don’t like the way it makes them feel.The truth doesn’t care about your feelingsThey also ridicule the idea that it’s wise to wait to have sex atleast until it’s with someone with whom you’re willing to raise a child.They just want to get their nut, and have the “right” to kill another human being if it gets in their way.",HippyDippyCommieGuy

You would agree that blacks, in general, support and vote overwhelming for leftists causes?   I hope that is changing but I believe that is the reality we still live in.I wholeheartedly support the concept that what color one is does tell me their character and that conservatives should embrace other conservatively minded folks.",stoffel_bristov

It's too easy to nowadays and we just need a friendly reminder of what we're really doing when we think like that, which is why I didn't explicitly say you're racist or anything. I don't know you personally and it wouldn't be fair or honest to make that judgment based on just that particular comment. You're right in noting that blacks as a whole vote overwhelmingly democrat, but a leftist could say the same about whites making up like 77% of republicans, therefore racism. Which they sadly probably say. But it's a faulty way of thinking and the left is superb with using certain words and phrases and framing statistics any which way to push forth their narrative.I'm not entirely sure if I feel that blacks overwhelmingly vote for leftist causes, but certainly they vote democrat overwhelmingly. I do know that leftism comes and goes in waves. The last big one was the late 60's and 70's, which weren't very good times. And the latest one is going on right now. I think that with a larger black middle and upper class, they'll tend to vote more conservatively, as every other group does, with exceptions of course. Once you feel the sting, and see the lack of results, you start to see democrats policies for what they are. The left and the media is working very hard with their narratives to prevent that. And sometimes I think they're winning. But people are changing their minds. It only takes exposing a few of the left's lies to make someone want to question more or all of it. Overall I'm hopeful though. I really do think that would be the nail in the coffin for the left in this latest wave of leftism, if enough people who are minorities get fed up with the lefts lunacy, but it's an uphill battle right now. It's tough to convince people to change their mind if they think one party is actively trying to help them, and another is actively against them.",Mswizzle23

They ask for more money every year, and liberals who don't want to do any tough work will vote for it so they're ""doing something"" about the issue. The homeless rate never goes down, and there are zero visible signs of success. This, of course, necessitates even more money. Rinse and repeat, every damn year.I like the main thesis of the video, which is that this is a drug abuse issue. 95% of the problematic homeless on the street are out of their minds on drugs. SF has plenty of homeless services, but the people who cause all the problems don't utilize them because they don't allow you to openly shoot up or smoke crack, etc.I'm not the only one moving right here - everyone I know who lives here is sick of this shit and openly discusses ways to get rid of the tents and the open drug use.

In fact it was astounding at first how many were either brought as children, or cane across as adults. One day I went to visit a family from our congregation (let’s call them the Sanchez). We had a great visit and they invited us over for dinner the following Tuesday. On Sunday thenSanchez family came to church, but brother Sanchez wasn’t there. When I asked if he wasn’t feeling well they informed me that he had been deported. I was blown away! I gave my condolences, offered comfort, asked if the church or I could do anything to help. They just lackadaisically shrugged me off and went about their day. I tried to cancel the dinner but Ms. Sanchez insisted that another minister and I still come over. Well, we came over on Tuesday because, even though the family looked as though they didn’t care, we figured it was just shock. Tuesday rolls around and we knock on their door and who should answer but Mr. Sanchez! We were dumbfounded so we asked what happened. He said, “what!? You think they can keep me out of this country?! I’ll just keep paying the right people and I’ll keep coming back”. He thought it was a joke, but man, I was shocked at how lax the border security was and how little these people worried about deportation.This was just one example of many. Sadly we don’t control the border, the Cartels do. I’m a god fearing man who loves all my brothers and sisters, and God has always advocated strong borders so there can be prosperity for all, even the “strangers who come into your house”.

Trump wins in 2020, to massive reeeeeeee on the Left and the associated riots, investigations, media screeching, and deep state coup attempt v2.0.  The Republicans hold the Senate, but continue to be largely feckless and ineffective.  Ginsburg dies, but Breyer holds on to life somehow.  John Roberts transforms himself into Kennedy Mk 2, but his swing vote is negated by the new justice that Trump nominates to the SCOTUS to replace Ginsburg.  SCOTUS is therefore 5 originalists, 3 progressives, and 1 whatever Roberts feels like that morning.In 2022, the Democrats chip away at the Republican Senate numbers, and retain the House.  In 2024, the Republicans run a wide field of candidates for POTUS, while the Democrats pick a young, 'minority', ultra-liberal candidate.  The Democrats take the Senate by a thin majority (1-2 votes) and take the Presidency.  Why?  Because the electorate is fickle and likes to trade the Presidency between parties every 8 years.The first act of the Democrats is to pack the Supreme Court.  They pass a bill through pure majority in the House and Senate, and the President signs it.  They add six new justices, all extremely young and extremely progressive.  The Supreme Court is now 5 originalists, 9 progressives, and 1 whatever Roberts is.The second act is to bring a lawsuit up to the SCOTUS, alleging that the Electoral College is racist, discriminatory, and does not grant equal representation to all citizens.  The SCOTUS tortures logic until it screams fo rmercy, and rules 9-6 that the Presidency will henceforth be decided by popular vote.Boom.",Colonize_The_Moon

So it wouldn’t be unreasonable to add two small red states (4 GOP senators and a few reps) to balance out the net gain (Ds would net something like 10 house seats, Rs would net 2 senate seats). Without good faith efforts to address the concerns (quite justified I believe) that the left supports statehood because they believe they’d be adding a solid blue state, we can’t reach an agreement suitable to accept PR.It’s obviously my hope that PR would come to be more conservative, and there have been promising signs at times from outreach, but I’m not about to give away 2 senate seats and a bunch of House seats on a hope.",YankeeBlues21

This is how its works.  Create a villain and give it a name (i.e. alt right) than push a bunch of bad stuff on the moniker (racism, intolerance, white nationalism, etc. etc.) ad nauseum.  It is really helpful in this step if you have a compliant media to relentlessly and continually push the bad stuff on the moniker as much as possible.  This is one of the reasons why leftists are especially good at perpetuating this technique.  Once the villian has been created and the public saturated with its bad stuff, its evil can be expanded to encompass anything one doesn't like.  We are at this stage with ""alt. right"".  The lefties are trying to expend its negative connotation to people like Ben Shapiro and Tucker Carlson because those are people who are really good at calling out lefties bullshit.  Its nothing but an attempt to smear them with an existing moniker that has been sufficiently villanized.Your confusion is understandable as leftists types and mass media are deliberately trying to villianize people with whom they disagree with politically.

A doctor can make any recommendation that they feel, but doctors are not gods. Frankly, I think we elevate the opinion of medical professionals way too much. They are often completely wrong and suggest things in more of a 'cover your ass' way than in the best interest of their patients. If my son were running a high fever, and I had some doctor tell me to take my twenty month old to the hospital.  Obviously, I would be concerned about my son and want to make sure that he were doing okay, but in terms of taking him if the fever broke and he was back down to 98 degrees. That would be a judgment call. I'd probably evaluate how he is doing; put him down for his bedtime. Check him before I went to bed, etc.Now in terms of the cops knocking before the swat was called or having the neighbor call their house, that's a fair point. My major problem with this story is that parents should not feel compelled to follow the medical advice of a doctor. It's bullshit, and while I can see why the judge might make the determination that he did - I feel like this clusterfuck is largely the problem of an overbearing government.",mycha1nsarebroken

""I asked, what's the president's status?"" Dowd said. ""[Mueller said] he's a witness-slash-subject. And I said, you mean he has no exposure? He said that's right. So I knew then for sure, by inference, that [Mueller] had nothing to proceed on in the collusion and conspiracy area.""So Mueller had already cleared Trump by March 2018.Turning to today's situation, Dowd said he was favorably impressed with Barr's summary of Mueller's key findings. But he felt Barr should have included a description of the Trump White House's cooperation with Mueller. As an example, Dowd pointed to notes taken by Annie Donaldson, a top aide to Don McGahn, then the White House counsel. Donaldson was present at critical meetings with the president and McGahn, and also Reince Priebus, then the White House chief of staff. She took detailed notes of the meetings, including what the president said. If she was not in the meeting, McGahn would go back to his office and dictate to Donaldson what had taken place.All those notes were turned over to Mueller. ""I challenge anyone to find a president that was so fully cooperative or transparent, and I must say particularly the intimate notes of his counsel and other senior staff that we produced,"" Dowd said. ""Annie Donaldson's notes will take you 15 hours to read through them. They are the real-time comments and thoughts of the president in conference with Don McGahn and other lawyers at various times, and chief of staff Priebus, and other people. It was remarkable that that material was produced.""Amazing level of cooperation and transparency. Giving them notes from conversations with counsel? This was a joke, it never should have gone on this long.Dowd was well-known as an advocate of cooperation with the Mueller probe, believing it would help Mueller finish his job quickly. In that, he was disappointed. Dowd hoped Mueller would be done by the end of 2017 — ""By early December, he had exhausted all of the evidence and the witnesses"" — but the investigation dragged on until March 2019. Still, Dowd's cooperation policy yielded other benefits. Most significantly, it was a powerful argument against the accusation that Trump obstructed justice. ""How could you possibly think this guy obstructed when he was so cooperative?"" Dowd asked.Emphasis mine.",zroxx2

1.0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com//r/Conservative/comments/b6q5wy/karl_rove_move_on_from_robert_mueller_mr_president.html,"Article:Only Donald Trump’s inauguration in 2017 could have been a sweeter day for the present occupants of the White House than last Sunday. The publication of Attorney General William Barr’s letter summarizing special counsel Robert Mueller’s report lifted an enormous political weight off President Trump and his team.Mr. Mueller found no evidence that “the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” Mr. Barr concluded “the evidence developed” during the Mueller investigation “is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.” These findings demolished the principal “resistance” talking points, leaving many Democrats angry and discombobulated.Some, especially in the House, will keep pushing for impeachment. This will enthuse many in the party’s hard-core base, but swing voters trust the Mueller investigation’s core findings and its leader. Speaker Nancy Pelosi knows obsessing over impeachment will benefit Mr. Trump and Republicans, but she will find it hard to contain her caucus’s overeager members. Witness Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, doubling down Tuesday on allegations of collusion.The president and his allies have raised concerns about how the Federal Bureau of Investigation brought on this investigation, especially pointing to possible abuse in seeking Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants. Did the FBI tell FISA that information supporting the warrant requests came from opposition research bankrolled by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party?These questions should be answered, but Mr. Trump need not devote much time to pressing them. He can count on Mr. Barr, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz to continue cleaning up the FBI and Justice Department. Mr. Horowitz is already investigating possible FISA abuses.There’s also Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, who promises to get to the bottom of “disturbing” aspects of the FBI and Justice Department’s 2016 and 2017 activities. As House manager of the 1998 Clinton impeachment effort, he learned the importance of not overplaying your hand.Mr. Trump now has an unusual chance to fashion something like the presidential honeymoon that media bitterness over Hillary Clinton’s loss denied him when he took office. Team Trump should use the Mueller report to pivot to issues, like the economy and the opioid crisis, that matter to swing voters who will decide the 2020 presidential election.As they do, Mr. Trump needs to understand that despite months of relentlessly railing against a “witch hunt,” his supporters are not as revved up as his detractors. That’s the conclusion of the March 20 Fox News poll, which surveyed voters before the Mueller probe ended. While it found Mr. Trump’s approval rating to be 46%—approaching his February 2017 high of 48%—only 27% strongly approve of the president while 42% strongly disapprove.The Mueller report may help Mr. Trump’s rating and, more important, drive an increase in his strongly-approve numbers and a decrease in his strongly disapproves. After all, he was proved right and his worst detractors were proved wrong. But reiterating old grievances about the investigation’s unfairness won’t materially change those ratings.The president should focus his time, voice and tweets on the roaring economy, impressive job creation and bigger paychecks. The Fox poll found that even with partisan polarization and the clutter of the Mueller investigation, 50% approve of his handling of the economy, while 42% disapprove. A March 17 CNN survey found 71% rate economic conditions as good, versus only 27% who said they were poor.Still, the administration needs to propose new policies to keep prosperity growing and spreading, and defend the policies it already put in place. For while Americans feel good about the present state of the economy, only 37% in the Fox poll said they were confident about it. Forty-three percent felt nervous about the economy and 17% were mixed. Reassurance is now critical.Whatever policies the administration pursues, it should remember that in the Fox News poll former Vice President Joe Biden beats Mr. Trump 47% to 40% and Sen. Bernie Sanders leads him 44% to 41%, while Mr. Trump defeats Sen. Elizabeth Warren 42% to 41% and Sen. Kamala Harris 41% to 39%. The most important number is that between 13% and 20% of voters are still up for grabs.It is on these swing voters—not the loyal GOP base—that Team Trump must focus. Neither party can win in 2020 with only its strongest supporters. The party that mounts the better effort to persuade swing voters will likely be the winner of the coming presidential election.",ChunkyArsenio

1.0,1.0,https://www.reddit.com//r/Conservative/comments/b6pwqx/dan_henninger_the_terminator_democrats.html,"Article:With one big difference, the Democratic Party, since the day Donald Trump won the 2016 election, has looked like the killer android at the end of “The Terminator.”Its flesh burned off, the Terminator’s endoskeleton continues to pursue Sarah and Kyle into a labyrinthine factory. A bomb blows off the Terminator’s legs, but the android still won’t stop. It drags the top half of its body across the floor and with its dying hand tries to crush Sarah, until a hydraulic press finally puts out the last blinking red light in its eyes.The big difference? The Terminator was a programmed robot, while the Democrats, in theory, possess actual human intelligence. Beyond that, I’m hard put to see the difference between the relentless android and Jerry Nadler, Adam Schiff, Tom Steyer or any of the other anti-Trumpers and NeverTrumpers who for two years have crawled across broken glass to terminate this presidency.One may reasonably ask: What was that all about? That the opposition simply wanted to “get Trump” is an insufficient explanation for the scale of this obsession. Nor is it sufficient to say the opposition emerged from Mr. Trump’s rhetoric about immigrants and such.None of that explains why so many once-sober Federal Bureau of Investigation bureaucrats went rogue in 2016. It doesn’t explain why after the election professional Democrats formed themselves into what they called “the Resistance,” as if suddenly they’d all become characters in “Les Misérables.”Something snapped in the opposition’s psyche. They started wailing about “our democracy.” The panic over this presidency became Trump Derangement Syndrome.A point arrived in the past year when any serious observer could have sensed that the Russian collusion narrative was losing elevation. The Beltway media divisions had chased the story’s Russia strands since January 2017 but failed to push it past peripheral figures in the Trump orbit, such as George Papadopoulos, or Roger Stone’s fever swamps.You would have thought the Democrats might have started months ago to prepare their side for a soft landing. Instead, they took their midterm election success, with anti-Trump sentiment evident in many suburbs, as proof—however disconnected from political logic—that Robert Mueller’s prosecutors would deliver the president to them on a platter.Now what? In the past 48 hours, some Democrats have started to recover from the Mueller neutron bomb. Speaker Nancy Pelosi is attempting to “pivot” to health care. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, is promoting its For the People agenda, which virtually no one has heard of.The Pelosi pivot makes sense—unless Trump Derangement Syndrome is a habit that can’t be kicked. Is Rachel Maddow now going to do nightly riffs on the details of For the People? I don’t see a lot of late-night laughs in Rep. Rosa DeLauro’s pay-equity bill.There may be one rationale for restarting Trump derangement with House hearings on whatever obstruction-of-justice crumbs the Mueller report reveals: It likely would enrage Mr. Trump and move him off the high of his Mueller win and back into the gutter with Messrs. Nadler and Schiff. Mrs. Pelosi knows how to play good-cop/bad-cop.As to the media, they’ll be back. Watch for CNN’s Jim Acosta to test the Trump temper eventually. The not-crazy goal of reviving Mr. Trump’s road rage would be to separate him from the disaffected suburban voters who this week are giving him a second look.Meanwhile, the AOC Effect isn’t going to disappear. If little else, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has proved that a tension now exists in politics between traditional policy substance and social-media emoting. Social media gets prime time. Straight policy gets next to nothing.Still, Mitch McConnell’s forcing Senate Democrats into an embarrassing “present” vote on AOC’s Green New Deal suggests social-media pipe dreams aren’t ready yet for the reality of congressional vote-counting.But what Congress does may be diminishing in importance if the big prize is winning the presidency, which itself is becoming more dependent on shaping mass opinion by using the skill sets of social media—and all that implies for our politics. Especially for the Democrats.One thing it implies is you don’t have to be substantive or even serious. See the Beto O’Rourke phenomenon. His candidacy seems to be about attaching his persona to a political demographic whose main concern is feeling good about feeling good about themselves—and various vague beliefs. He didn’t originate the idea.It also implies that a Democratic presidential candidate must conform to social media’s progressive values, on display this week in Joe Biden’s incredible grovel about how “the white man’s culture” has “got to change.”One verity in our politics existed before the Mueller era and remains: Donald Trump is the incumbent U.S. president. History shows incumbent presidents are very hard to defeat. Defeating this one, derangement and all, just got harder.",ChunkyArsenio

HUD is also charging that Facebook enabled advertisers to exclude people based upon their neighborhood by drawing a red line around those neighborhoods on a map. Facebook also allegedly gave advertisers the option of showing ads only to men or only to women.Apparently, there are exceptions to the fair housing laws, but none of those exceptions apply to advertising. It's legal for a person looking for a roommate to discriminate for any reason. It's legal for a person with 3 or fewer houses to not rent to a disabled person. But none of those exceptions apply to advertising, so it's not legal for Facebook to provide those filters when creating an ad.I guess this follows the letter of the law, but it's hard to call it ""conservative"".",aboardthegravyboat

They love this idea because it ignores the possibility of left wing political corruption.This is what they always do, including with prior developments in the Smollett case.  When people believed him, it was a story that symbolically represents America as a country and how racist it is.  When it turned out he was lying, that attitude was completely reversed, this story doesn't have any larger meaning about left wing politics and activism, it's simply a story about one guy who's a liar, nothing to see here.It's amazing how so many people on the left completely lack the self-awareness to see these contradictions.

If you violate those rules, and it’s a private college, they can kick you off campus, call the police for trespassing, or discipline you through things like expulsion if you’re a student. Private colleges & universities still receive massive amounts of money from the federal government, so the government has a vested interest in promoting free speech on college campuses. An example would be Johns Hopkins University, which is a private university, and receives more than $2bn in research funding (not to mention federally funded student loans, although those are clearly dwarfed by R&D in this particular case).",ItsALivingFlyingCirc

7.0,6.0,https://www.reddit.com//r/Conservative/comments/b648wx/smollett_case_not_over_its_just_beginning_its.html,"Whether or not it’s a good idea to cut funding because of speech codes is irrelevant. The only important thing is that speech codes are legal, and cutting funding discourages them.  Lynching was already illegal in every state.  Banning lynching at a federal level is nothing more than virtue signaling by the Democrats (ironically the party that was responsible for virtually every single lynching that took place in this country).  It was already illegal. Making illegal at two levels doesn’t discourage the behavior any more.I was not trying to defend the attempts to cut funding over speech codes, merely pointing out the obvious distinction between that & federal lynching laws. But, since you insist on moving the goal posts, I’ll play ball. For now.Federal welfare & entitlement programs aren’t constitutional (despite the fact that the Supreme Court justices acquiesced to FDR when he threatened to pack the court). Eliminate Federal welfare & entitlement programs, and the states can do as they see fit with respect to welfare & trespass laws.Yes I think the research at Johns Hopkins outweighs the feelings of people crying victim hood... so they shouldn’t jeopardize their funding to ban speech that might offend someone into crying victim. The people whose whining got the speech codes implemented in the first place are the ones crying victim. Not the people who are being genuinely punished (i.e. victimized) for free expression. Furthermore those people aren’t exactly crying about it. Fighting their schools to be readmitted?  Sure. Voting for politicians who support free expression?  Clearly. But crying?  That’s almost exclusively being done by the sort of folks who complain to administrators over offensive costumes & micro-aggressions.I disagree with cutting research funding (to JHU, or any other university) because of speech codes. I do, however, support eliminating federally backed student loans, but that has nothing to do with the presence of speech codes.  Research is a non-excludable, non-rivalrous good, and so it’s clearly within the proper role of the government to fund it. Student loans are neither of those two things, so the government shouldn’t fund student loans, particularly when that money is going to schools that don’t even agree with the core principles of the United States.",ItsALivingFlyingCirc

1.0,4.0,https://www.reddit.com//r/Conservative/comments/b6beoh/pencil_neck_schiff_and_the_media.html,"Article:No self-respecting journalist is going to stop using a source because of an instruction from the White House. But the media question of the day is why members of the press corps aren’t deciding on their own to reject the source who seems to have been misleading them for years.The Washington Post reports that the Trump communications team is urging media outlets to avoid booking House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), who has long claimed to have seen “more than circumstantial” evidence of Trump-Russia collusion but has never backed up his claim.One might expect any reasonable person, journalist or not, to stop providing a platform to someone who had gone two full years without backing up a sensational claim. One might also expect a journalist to get especially angry about a gap of 24-months—and counting—between publication and corroboration. But Mr. Schiff is still enjoying generally respectful coverage, despite peddling a message which has become both discredited and incoherent in the wake of special counsel Robert Mueller’s finding that there was no evidence of collusion.Now the Washington Post reports:“Undoubtedly there is collusion,” Schiff said in an interview this week, after Attorney General William P. Barr submitted a four-page letter to Congress summarizing key aspects of Mueller’s report.The Post further quotes Mr. Schiff:“We will continue to investigate the counterintelligence issues. That is, is the president or people around him compromised in any way by a hostile foreign power?” What’s to investigate and why is he still posing the question, if he already has direct evidence showing—without a doubt—that the Trump team colluded with Russia?The Post report exposes further the untenable nature of Mr. Schiff’s position:Still, Schiff has taken steps to put the panel’s investigation on hold, pending the release of Mueller’s findings. On Monday, he announced that the committee had indefinitely postponed a planned hearing with Felix Sater, a former business associate of the president’s who was involved with the pursuit to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Schiff said the pause is temporary, adding that the intelligence panel might still uncover “deeply compromising” evidence in its counterintelligence investigation that falls outside the scope of Mueller’s criminal probe.What could be more deeply compromising than the direct evidence Mr. Schiff claims to have discovered of a conspiracy with a hostile foreign power to rig an American election? And if Mr. Schiff actually has such evidence that our republic is a sham and a foreign agent is in the Oval Office, why on earth has he been sitting on it for two years and why would he now agree to delay disclosure even further?Deceptions by officials with access to the relevant information are worse than those resulting from honest media coverage. Embarrassed Pulitzer winners can at least claim they were misled by their various anonymous sources into overplaying the story. And of course the embarrassment extends beyond the Pulitzer crowd. In May of last year, this column noted:The Washington press corps has spent a few days being embarrassed about Michelle Wolf’s raunchy and mean-spirited presentation at Saturday’s annual dinner for the White House Correspondent’s Association. In the fullness of time, they may find it even more difficult to defend another part of the evening’s program.Specifically, the association had awarded its annual prize for “excellence in presidential news coverage under deadline pressure” to Evan Perez, Jim Sciutto, Jake Tapper and Carl Bernstein of CNN. The judges wrote:These four journalists and a number of other CNN reporters broke the story that the intelligence community had briefed President Barack Obama and then-President elect Donald Trump that Russia had compromising information about Trump. The CNN team later reported that then-FBI Director James Comey personally briefed Trump about the dossier. Thanks to this CNN investigation, “the dossier” is now part of the lexicon. The depth of reporting demonstrated in these remarkable and important pieces, and the constant updates as new information continued to be uncovered showed breaking news reporting at its best.Of course now the whole world knows how laughable it is to put “dossier” and “depth of reporting” in the same paragraph. And even at the time it should have raised eyebrows. This column noted:In some quarters the award will be controversial not eventually but immediately for two reasons. The first is the judges’ decision to honor Carl Bernstein, who is among a group of non-doctors who occasionally appear on television to offer long distance diagnoses of the President’s mental health. This can reasonably be described as fake news.The other immediately controversial aspect of the award is that the judges selected the CNN gang for the prize and gave only an “honorable mention” to NBC’s Lester Holt for getting Donald Trump on tape explaining why he fired former FBI Director James Comey. Whatever one thinks of Mr. Trump or Mr. Comey or whether special counsel Robert Mueller has a case, this was clearly a big scoop.As for the winning entry, what exactly was it? Barring some huge new revelation of Russian collusion from Mr. Mueller, it appears that CNN was duped into advancing a partisan attack on a duly-elected President.Now we know that CNN was indeed duped into playing up the bogus dossier and the collusion story—and CNN was not alone. But at least the journalists can claim that without direct access to classified information, they had to rely on the words of others. Mr. Schiff has no such excuses. And the media should not accept any from him.",ChunkyArsenio

Consider yourself informed as to why Race has taken center stage, and you can thank the Democrats for that 100%.  To not face off on the issues that are crammed down our throats and used to beat us down is just...… I don't know what to call that.
