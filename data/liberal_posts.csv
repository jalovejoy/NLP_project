You may remember that about her, but [she clearly does not](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/19/nancy-pelosi-impeachment-gift-donald-trump-without-gop-support/3211241002/).

&gt; In an exclusive interview with USA TODAY, Pelosi said some House progressives have ""wanted to impeach the president [sic] since the day he got elected [sic].""

&gt; ""You're wasting your time, unless the evidence is so conclusive that the Republicans will understand,"" Pelosi, D-Calif., told USA TODAY.   

Got that?  Democrats are somehow being *partisan* and *unfair* to Trump, according to her, and the Constitution is a waste of time unless Republicans give her permission to do her job - a job **she only has in the first place because American voters ignored her advice.**  

And she says this crap just a few days after Trump parroted the Nazi terrorists in NZ, reminding us all that he has also incited Nazi mass-murderers in this country - and likely will continue doing so with impunity every moment that he holds power.  Pelosi is now actively, *publicly* defending a treasonous, terrorist-inciting white supremacist dictator against her own party and country.  

You may remember in 2018 that Pelosi had denounced the voter revolt that put her into the Speakership as ""uncivil,"" and responded to a wave of American disgust with Republicans by vowing ""bipartisanship"" as leader of the House of Representatives - the chamber of Congress that is *meant* by its very design to be contentious and (get this) *representative*.  

The most charitable interpretation left at this point is that she's a delusional millionaire living in her own little world of collegial DC politics, who would still be chasing ~~peace in our time~~ ""bipartisanship"" with Russpublican tanks rolling down the street and Glorious Leader Trumpsky reviewing them from a balcony in a fur hat.  

It is almost indisputable at this point: Nancy Pelosi has clearly forgotten what country this is, what party she claims to belong to, and the most basic Constitutional duties of her job, even just as an ordinary member of Congress - let alone Speaker of the House.

If you're not a follower of liberal talk radio, you may not realize that the field of talkers has diminished quite a bit. I'm not an expert, so I may be out of the loop with different markets and not be fully aware of all talkers, but I've been listening to a couple of the nationally syndicated talkers for 10 years and some change.

At this point, it's a small field on terrestrial radio: **Stephanie Miller** and **Thom Hartmann**. Most recently, **Norman Goldman** ceased operation in mid-February. He used to be on in the evenings, EST. **Bill Press** appears to only run on WCPT in Chicago. But it's a different game on other formats.

I'm not an expert in radio, nor do I work in the business, but I've always been a radio-phile, myself, and since this is a format that seems to be struggling and dwindling (much like other radio formats), I'm curious to know if it's a national trend or just some markets.

I'm thinking listening *age* and *style* are two major factors;  


**Age**

Since most talk radio is on AM...talk radio skews to an older demographic, so if a 20-35 year old was going to listen, they're not likely to go to AM radio because ""my dad and grand-dad listened to **that**"". They'd prefer to stream it or go the podcast route.

&amp;#x200B;

**Style**

I just don't hear the delivery of liberal talk to be the same as conservative talk. Where I live, the local talkers go with a simple format: ""Liberals bad. Liberals trying to destroy us. They're at it at again!"" And if there's any headlines that liberals or conservatives could find a way to agree on (natural disasters, Westboro Baptist thugs, major tragedies), they spin it so they can continue to push the ""liberals bad"" narrative. Hate to say it, but it **sells**.   


And maybe that's why conservative talk is such a big winner...it's a *safe sell*. Plus, look at how few independent radio stations there are out there (By that I mean, less than a handful of stations owned by one company or an individual) compared to how many are owned by entities like iHeart and Cumulus, etc. It's amazing, but there are markets that have clearly done well with liberal talkers and have been flipped to something else despite that fact. A couple of years back, iHeart owned a station in LA that was Stephanie Miller's flagship station and they dropped her show for Limbaugh. Two years later, his ratings were still lower than hers prior to her show leaving. 

Again, I'm not in the radio biz, so I don't understand how it all works...but radio is in such a struggle, it seems. We've had a handful of stations flip several times since the mid-2000's. That was unheard of in the years before. Not that stations would flip, but flip at that rate. Crazy.  


Anyway, I'm curious to know if there are other regular listeners out there and for those of you who aren't listeners, why? Again, trying to get the convo going.

I want you to introduce you to the one that's the furthest right, because it's still considerably too much left wing for Republicans. The party is called SPD or ""Strana Přímé Demokracie"" or in english The Party of Direct Democracy"".

Its program mirrors some parts Republican program. It is very much against accepting illegal immigrants and Islam, against giving welfare to lazy moochers, affirmative action, still increasing taxes for the rich and loosening bureaucracy to support businessmen as well as starting businessmen, they want liberation from international organization (in this case EU), strict law and order, are sceptic about gay rights and are against taking gun rights (Although in Czechia gun rights are already very controlled and in order to own one, you need to get a license, like for a car). Sounds familiar?

With such program, they're considered as basically far right extremist party, even though you Americas must be used to it. Now here are some points, which significantly differ them from republicans:

They favor actual fiscal responsibility and balanced budget, want to influence government programs such as education and Healthcare and IMPROVE it by better funding (unlike Republicans whose only answer to faulty government program is to defund it, make it private and turn it into shit), support useful college fields, raise wages to teachers as well as doctors and policemen. They support welfare programs for those, who actually need it, better conditions and improvement of rights for workers, make corrupt politicians and rich people responsible for their misdeeds, they don't reason their views on religious zealousy, so they aren't ""pro-life"" (as far as I know. Although if they are against abortions, they at least support welfare handouts for those who need, including (and especially) young parents), don't support abstinence-only sex education and creationism in schools and I doubt that their opposition to gay rights is based on faith, they're against property being obtained illegally (which would be penalized with 100% tax), which is unlike Republicans who don't care how you obtain anything, and they want to reform political system as a direct democracy, hence the name.

Not that I really trust them, because probably each of our parties are against corruption, yet Czechia is one of the most corrupt countries in Europe, so they're probably not any different. But I wanted to share interesting fact.

GeorgeSorosToe,0,False,,,t3_axsxkk,94,0,,https://www.reddit.com//r/Liberal/comments/axsxkk/ive_finally_defected_from_rt_d/,314,"So I’ll preface this by letting everyone know that over the last 5 years I have been undergoing a radical shift in my world views and political stances. Just for reference, I am now 24 years of age. 

I was born and raised in a southern rural community by a Jewish mother (now Christian), and a w.a.s.p father. Needless to say, my upbringing was very conservative. I had a pretty easy life, never really knew hardship or money problems. Fox News on constantly in the house, military grandfather, lots of closeted racism...you get the picture.

From 18-22 I voted republican in generals and primaries. I thought I was doing the right thing. At 22, I met my (now) wife. She is a black woman. Not usually an important detail in general, but due to my upbringing, and the town I’m from, it’s out of the ordinary and I definitely expected backlash. Some came, but none from my family, thankfully. They love her, and have changed a lot of their ways of thinking. 

Anyway, she and I are both relatively intelligent people, up and up on our current events, politics, etc. but we had completely opposite views. A lot of the issues I never took notice of such as inequality, racism, systemic oppression, wage gaps, inequity, what have you, i had never given much thought to, and or, considered relevant or significant. Her story of her upbringing in public housing and her struggles as a person of color in our area of the nation really struck me. She is on the deans list at her university, a solid professional woman. I was always under the assumption that those sort of complaints came from deadbeats, etc. I was so wrong. I know that.

Anyway, after a couple of years of being exposed to new schools of political thought, I began to challenge the conservative narrative whenever I could. I began to be a supporter of universal healthcare, lgbtq rights, end of the war on drugs, ending modern imperialism, combating climate change, free college, etc. When I would see hateful posts on r/t_d that I used to love and agree with, I would become sickened with the human capacity to hate and denigrate another. I started voicing my opinions. Much to the chagrin of all active users there. I was threatened, doxed, insulted. It blew my mind. These were the same people that not too long ago were kind to me. 

Idk where I’m going here. I’m rambling. I just wanted to come here and say that I’m here now. I understand my errors. I know what’s right. I have a wonderful woman to thank for that. Her patience and faith in the good in me have prevailed. I’m not an incel beta cuck for desiring a decent existence for my fellow man like the people on r/t_d would have me believe. It requires a great deal of strength to shoulder truly caring about everyone you meet. Caring that they make enough money to survive, that they’re properly educated, that they have upward mobility.. Calloused Indifference (like the kind exhibited on r/t_d) requires no courage, strength, or utility. 

I’ve defected, and I’m so damned happy I made it out clean on the other side. They hate those of us who would work to do good for each other. I’ve seen who these people are first hand. I was one of them. We have to match their strength and aggression. We can’t get by on peace and love any more. We have to take the fight to them.

However, some of these are considered left-of-center, but they touch on issues that I believe are important, but have little nagging doubts from my conservative past about.

I also overhear stuff from peers from Fox News and singular conservative talk shows. It's all about the left lying and why Trump is trying his best and a very Christian bias, as well.

I just have a hard time wrapping my head around this pretty far-fetched concept of propaganda. Are the left wing sources propaganda that is indoctrination, or is it the right wing sources? If they both show different sides (albeit one being less alluring to me), aren't they both indoctrination in different ways?

Zelk,0,False,,,t3_apkd57,2,0,,https://www.reddit.com//r/Liberal/comments/apkd57/counter_points_about_hating_government/,5,"A government is  the governing body of a nation, state, or community. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's that simple. It doesn't matter where you go, the moment more than one person is working together there is some kind of government at play.   


Today on Ask Trump Supporters, a question was posed asking when does the government best the private sector. Incredibly, the most common response is the Military. That command economy merit based society with high training, welfare, hands on management, held accountable, regulated faction of the United States that commands floating cities with more airpower than most nations in the world, and global reach.    


Ask for examples.  
When talking to anyone trying to sell you that the private, plutocratic, invisible hand mentality is the best way to go, ask for examples in real life and history. Because at no time in history did a plutocratic/ corporate society held out for long before the economy stagnated and corruption rotted that system of government to the ground. 

&amp;#x200B;

The best reasons to have an organized governing structure is accountability, anti-corruption, data tiered data analysis of the people and resources, and bulk purchases of goods and services to supply to the public and prepare for disasters and issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Explain basic civics.**   
There are generally two axis to most government types. Power and authority on one, wealth and economy on the other. 

&amp;#x200B;

With power and authority, three of the most basic examples are easily explained as starting points. A single ruler (Monarch, Dictator), a layered rule (Republic, leader based), and a rule by the people (Democracy). Each with advantages and disadvantages.  


[https://trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/teacher\_lessons/3branches/1.htm](https://trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/teacher_lessons/3branches/1.htm)

&amp;#x200B;

**A King.**

A single ruler is quick and easy. Fast and effective. However is quicker to corrupt and pursuaid into making bad decisions, especially when they believe they are the best of the best because of the seat of power they hold. In the States, we have the president who is elected mostly by the general population to fill this role, and can act as a dictator in times of emergencies and crisis. Because an imperfect action is often better than no action at all.

&amp;#x200B;

**Representatives**

A layered rule such as a Republic or some kind of body of leaders offers better information and management of specialized tasks and responsibilities. It requires more effort to corrupt and distort as hopefully merit based and elected officials will have a shared say, and have to discuss with peers for actions. It also means they are held accountable by their peers if embezzlement or criminal activity is pursued or carried out. In the states we have Congress and the Senet. Elected into office by groups of people to represent them. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Rule by all**

A total democracy is a full rule by the people, it's slow and a fools vote is equal to a scholar. Democracy is determined by how accountable the government is to the people, and whether or not the government reflect the populations best interest, or is corrupt and serving other powers such as a foreign body or corruption. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Wealth &amp; Economy**  
This is where Conservatives will tell you the government fails at most. Spending other people's money is the worst way to go about things and should be avoided at all cost and try to sell you that private business is the best way to go. I have no examples of when privatization was better than an uncorrupted government once funding was factored in. Every project in history performed best when it was given resources, proper management, and was held accountable. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Economic Anarchy**  
Free Market and the invisible hand. Where the wealth is, incentives follow. No regulations or management is taken into account and theft against the poor and powerless via slavery is quick to take effect. Workers can't defend themselves against an organized power with money and marshal forces so they are limited to basic work. Micro empires rise as corporations, but in every instance, the most organized, regulated groups of people take over and the Freemarket disappears. It is the line when the greed get too greedy, paranoid, and are overthrown. The fall of Capitalism is when consumers are bankrupt and the wealthy blame them for it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Command Economies, Socialism &amp; Communism.**

The very moment control is taken to manage resources is when a command economy takes shape. Socialism is where the governing body takes control of some or all services to enable the public to perform well, by mass managing, bulk buying and problem prevention through trends and analysis goods and services such as roads, military, disaster response, emergency response, medical, financial safety nets, disability management, and so on. The last elements to be taken over and the push into Communism occurs when luxury services and economic caps are put in place to regulate the wealthy and prevent them from becoming too powerful to manage, and leave ruin the state. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Examples**

We have many examples in history regarding the private sector taking over, and the moment a business opens shares to the public, workers comp and investments drop. The moment pro-profit healthcare was allowed under Reagan, we saw healthcare costs increase. When we look at public and private schools, the biggest factor is money. Public schools that are well funded and regulated perform just as well as private schools.   


In the United States, we have cities that specialize and perform better due to the focused mindset than if they were attempting to be jack of all trades social centers. Unless you seriously think everyone should design and build their own car from scratch, it's a very good idea that we have predictable settings such as roads that are maintained for specialized vehicles to operate on, designed by people who specialize in vehicular design. They couldn't design those cars if they were too busy farming and training in a militia. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My final thoughts ranting about this**

The only people who are trying to tell us the government is bad are people who are either ignorant of basic civics, economics, and history to know better, or are lying and trying to sell mass privatization to fleece the population of power and wealth.   


This has been a rant that is my observation and understanding to explain what the fuck a government is, because this argument is beyond stupid by now. I hope better people chime in here to correct and refine my attempt here. To create a post that can be easily linked to for educational purposes as to what the hell government is and why its used. Accountability and management.   


If you read this and hate the government, I honestly hope you chime in with outstanding examples of how the private sector, with the same economic resources, outperformed a managed government organization. Because as we have so far, Governments landed on the moon,[invented the computer](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000984.htm), built roads in Roman times, and as we see in the Military, are capable of identifying and applying organizational practices that give us the most bang for the buck. The only modern examples I can think of would be the fact that [NASA needs more funding.](https://www.21stcentech.com/money-spent-nasa-not-waste/)

&amp;#x200B;

So when you try to tell me that Government is stupid, or some other nonsense, I'm going to need you to clarify. Because as far as I'm concerned, corruption is the problem, and Conservatives don't hate organizations, they hate being held accountable and having regulations keep them in check from making money off the suffering of others.  


As usual, I'm going to post something I picked up somewhere. Two links that show how Conservatives are the problem in America, and I have yet to see anything that counter discusses this.

Just wanna start off by saying I don't want to argue pro-life vs pro-choice or anything like that. Only reason I came here is because I felt this would be the best place to hear from some pro-choice people on this bill. 

Here's the text from a conversation between Todd Gilbert (R) and Kathy Tran (D) about the details of this bill (video link will be put in comment since my original post was removed for having a Twitter link in it)

&gt;Gilbert: So how late in the third trimester would you be able to do that?

&gt;Tran: It’s very unfortunate that our physician witnesses were not able to attend today.

&gt;Gilbert: No, I’m talking about your bill. How late in the third trimester could a physician perform an abortion if he indicated it would impair the mental health of the woman?

&gt;Tran: Or physical health.

&gt;Gilbert: Okay. I’m talking about the mental health.
Tran: Through the third trimester. The third trimester goes all the way up to 40 weeks.

&gt;Gilbert: Okay. But to the end of the third trimester?

&gt;Tran: Yep. I don’t think we have a limit in the bill.

&gt;Gilbert: Where it’s obvious a woman is about to give birth, that she has physical signs that she is about to give birth. Would that be a point at which she could still request an abortion if she was so certified? She’s dilating.

&gt;Tran: Mr. Chairman, that would be a decision that the doctor, the physician, and the woman would make at that point.

&gt;Gilbert: I understand that. I’m asking if your bill allows that.

&gt;Tran: My bill would allow that, yes.


Am I correct in assuming that this is radical? Most pro-choice people I've interacted with don't seem to believe in this type of abortion.

Imagine the chaos that would proceed if there was NO USA government.  It could even be a prelude to an actual Russian attack.

KubrickIsMyCopilot,0,False,,,t3_a7gtjo,5,0,,https://www.reddit.com//r/Liberal/comments/a7gtjo/a_surreal_conversation_about_public_displays_of/,6,"Throughout this area, up and down all the major streets, there are permanent banners celebrating the military and locals who are in it.  Not people who died or *did* anything in particular, just people who happen to be in inform.  

Those displays have been there for years, and similar displays in other facets of local life have just been becoming more and more prevalent, while basically no other profession sees anything like that kind of public adulation.

Finally, I got irritated recently with something another person was saying on the subject, and expressed my long-held thoughts about it.  The result was a surreal dive into a rabbit hole of authoritarianism and brainwashing.

This is paraphrased, but captures the gist:

&gt; X: They deserve our respect and appreciation for their service.

Me: Do you feel the same way about teachers?

&gt; X: Absolutely.

Me: Where are the banners for the teachers?  

&gt; X: I'm sure they're in lots of places.

Me: Well, these banners for the military are *everywhere* around here.  

&gt; X: We don't want to leave anyone out, and they deserve a lot of respect for their service and sacrifice.

Me: Do nurses deserve a lot of respect for their service and sacrifice?

&gt; X: Of course, lots of people do.  This isn't about that.

Me: *Why* isn't it about that?  Why is every major street in this area covered in praise of the military, while every other form of service is treated like it doesn't exist?

&gt; X: Nothing stops you from putting up a display for teachers or anyone else.  Are you going to?

Me: It does *so* stop me from doing that - it's public property that needs approval from the city.  And those military displays aren't some private citizen group's spontaneous act of generosity, they're taxpayer-funded and part of a nationwide propaganda campaign that's been going on since 2003.

&gt; X: Our brave men and women in uniform deserve our respect for their service and sacrifice.

(*At this point I felt a chill at the robotic way the guy recited this phrase from memory*)

Me: If I went to the city council and proposed replacing half of those military displays with celebrations of local teachers, firefighters, nurses, doctors, or whatever, would you support it?

&gt; X: Why would we have to disrespect the troops to respect anyone else?

Me: Wait, so having *fewer* taxpayer-funded displays all over the city celebrating the military would be ""disrespectful"" to them?  They're *entitled* to being praised everywhere all the time?

&gt; X: They deserve all the respect we can give them.

Me: But it's not disrespectful of teachers, nurses, scientists, etc. to have *no* significant displays honoring them?  Fewer displays for soldiers is ""disrespect,"" but no displays at all for anyone else is *not* disrespect?

&gt; X: The service and sacrifice of the troops deserve all the appreciation we can give them.  If you want to honor someone else, no one's stopping you.

Me: But they *are* stopping me.  I just told you that.  It's public property and they don't want to ""distract"" from the military displays by putting up other things.

&gt; X: Why are you so angry about this?  Don't you think our Brave Troops Deserve to Be Honored for Their Service and Sacrifice? 

It just went downhill from there.  I lost count of the number of times the terms ""service"" or ""sacrifice"" were used as a thought-terminating cliche to deflect from some painful contradiction they were caught in.
